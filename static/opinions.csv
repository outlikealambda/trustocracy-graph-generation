0,1455933763956,"Echo Base...I've got something! Not much, but it could be a life form. This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two. Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by. Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found them. Repeat, I found them. Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again.

Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you."
1,1462477686397,"Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back. Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?

Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dack. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station Three-T-Eight. We have spotted Imperial walkers! Imperial walkers on the north ridge. Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.  All right, boys, keep tight now. Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now! All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armor's too strong for blasters.

Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good.  You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.

You all right? Why are you still here? I heard the command center had been hit. You got your clearance to leave. Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope. Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters. Imperial troops have entered the base. Come on...that's it. Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports! K-one-zero...all troops disengage.  Oh! Wait for me! Begin retreat! Fall back!

Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me. My...! Why, you stuck up...half-witted...scruffy-looking...nerf-herder! Who's scruffy-looking? I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid? Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet? Headquarters personnel, report to command center. Take it easy. Excuse us, please."
2,1481034237882,"I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. Yoda will always be with you. Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view! Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. 

Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete."
3,1460384806963,"Luke? Luke? Luke? Have you seen Luke this morning? He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early. Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him? I think so. Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay! Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid...hit the accelerator.

Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from. I saw part of the message he was... I seem to have found it.

I'm not going anywhere. They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. But they're going to kill her! Better her than me... She's rich. Rich? Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... What? Well more wealth that you can imagine. I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! You'll get it! I better! You will...

All wings report in. Red Ten standing by. Red Seven standing by. Red Three standing by. Red Six standing by. Red Nine standing by. Red Two standing by. Red Eleven standing by. Red Five standing by. Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through their magnetic field. Hold tight! Switch your deflectors on. Double front!"
4,1458569126188,"Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!

It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...I never heard of them hitting anything this big before. They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers. These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise. Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home! Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous. Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!"
5,1459549553684,"Where is that shuttle going? Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination? Parts and technical crew for the forest moon. Do they have a code clearance? It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. Shall I hold them? No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself. As you wish, my lord. Carry on. They're not goin' for it, Chewie. Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course. Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.

We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you.

I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say? I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. Leia! Oh! Your Royal Highness. But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free. Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly -- Just tell them. You see, Master Luke they didn't believe me. Just as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. Thanks, Threepio. I...I never knew I had it in me.

It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge."
6,1465090181111,"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. Easy...you call that easy? Their tracking us! Not this ship, sister. At least the information in Artoo is still intact. What's so important? What's he carrying? The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet! It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money! You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!

What's wrong? Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo? Okay, easy she goes! Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you."
7,1479696832412,"Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe?"
8,1470145041550,"Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move."
9,1486471432415,"Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! Sorry!

There she is. See-Threepio, do you copy? For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship. We're right above you. Stand by. You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought. Nice! Come on! It's them! Blast them! Get back to the ship! Where are you going? Come back! He certainly has courage. What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! I think we took a wrong turn. There's no lock! That oughta hold it for a while. Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge. Oh, I think I just blasted it. They're coming through! Here, hold this. Here they come! For luck!

Luke? Luke? Luke? Have you seen Luke this morning? He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early. Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him? I think so. Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay! Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid...hit the accelerator.

Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going?"
10,1472798391446,"Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now. Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm? How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there? Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm? Mostly because of my father, I guess. Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm. "
11,1480413903803,"What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.

No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. You fought in the Clone Wars? Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father. I wish I'd known him. He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.

What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? Hey, Luke...may the Force be with you! What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.

Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move."
12,1458117184434,"Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? Come on! 

The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. That's impossible, even for a computer. It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters. Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!

They've coming in! Three marks at two ten. I'll take them myself! Cover me! Yes, sir. I can't maneuver! Stay on target. We're too close. Stay on target! Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this is Red Leader."
13,1485071994576,"You have learned much, young one. You'll find I'm full of surprises. Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true. No! All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. Impressive...most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me.

Let go. Sshh! et go, please. Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.

Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good.  You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.

All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports. Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?  The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood? Right. Okay. Good luck. Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!"
14,1463198898219,"Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice. Vader. Is the dark side stronger? No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. But how am I to know the good side from the bad? You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. But tell me why I can't... No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.

General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.  A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you. Thank you, General."
15,1472589832730,"How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You mean it controls your actions? Partially. But it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them."
16,1481656366363,"What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!

Distance to power generators? One-seven, decimal two-eight. Target. Maximum fire power. Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon. But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!! Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical. Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident! Wait! Wait!"
17,1463711276038,"General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.  A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you. Thank you, General.

Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone. Han! Leia!  Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control. I saw...I saw a city in the clouds. Mmm. Friends you have there. They were in pain. It is the future you see. Future? Will they die? Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future. I've got to go to them. Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.

The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone. And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not.  don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah! Oh, Artoo, let him have it. Mine! Mine! Artoo! Mine! Mine!"
18,1468020150115,"He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand. It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.

Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him?"
19,1481995812842,"Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. Stop that. Stop what? Stop that! My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of? Afraid? You're trembling. I'm not trembling."
20,1485244703864,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no."
21,1484199429524,"Stretch out with your feelings. You see, you can do it. I call it luck. In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else. Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan. You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.

Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. Look, sir -- droids.

How long before you can make the jump to light speed? It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer. Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining... Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? What's that flashing? We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed."
22,1460630274962,"Run, Luke! Run!

I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! I can't believe he's gone. There wasn't anything you could have done. Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet! You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!

Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports. Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another drill. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! Get to the top! I can't Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. Hurry! One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it! I'm trying! Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We've had some problems... Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great."
23,1471018628955,"Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one. Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.

Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three! It's not fair! The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault! No light-speed? It's not my fault. Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield. You're going to attack them?! Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer... Shut up!"
24,1460063091641,"There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They're for sale if you want them. 

You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.

My scope's negative. I don't see anything. Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up. Biggs! You've picked one up...watch it! I can't see it! Where is he?! He's on me tight, I can't shake him...I can't shake him. Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in. Got him!

Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! Sorry!"
25,1461499091866,"No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian. Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain. You will not deviate from your present course. Rather touchy, aren't they? I thought you knew this person. Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that. Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven. Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me. Who's worried?

You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up. Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right. Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo. Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope. Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed. Close the doors. Yes, sir.

Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time."
26,1469052146909,"Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here.

Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker."
27,1479162540910,"Rise, my friend. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. Yes, my Master. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. As you wish. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

Where is that shuttle going? Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination? Parts and technical crew for the forest moon. Do they have a code clearance? It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. Shall I hold them? No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself. As you wish, my lord. Carry on. They're not goin' for it, Chewie. Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course. Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.

Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message.

Luke! Luke! Oh, Master Luke. I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia. I hope she's alright. What, Chewie? What? Chewie! Hey, I don't get it. Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie. Chewie, wa-wait! Don't! "
28,1463342716342,"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. "
29,1467040612516,"Look! Get him off of there! I think I got it. I got it! Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? Let's see. It's not bad. Freeze! Oh, dear. Don't move! I love you. I know. Hands up! Stand up! Stay back. Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea.

Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here.

Fighters coming in. There's too many of them! Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader."
30,1477223007998,"That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. Leia! Leia's my sister. Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor."
31,1460624865217,"I told you to remain on the command ship. A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. Yes, I know. My son is with them. Are you sure? I have felt him, my Master. Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. They are clear, my Master. Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. He will come to me? I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you andthen you will bring him before me. As you wish.

Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi."
32,1460744131647,"What did you have in mind for your next move? Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas? No. Where are we? The Anoat system. Anoat system. There's not much there. No. "
33,1461954017565,"Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message.

The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy. Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. What's he saying? He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.

Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!"
34,1478608971898,"Oh. No one to meet us. I don't like this. Well, what would you like? Well, they did let us land. Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me. See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay? Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled. How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! Inever thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?

They're moving to attack position. Shields up! Track them. They may come around for another pass. Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. hey can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device. Well, there's no trace of them, sir. Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit. Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area. Yes, Captain Needa.

Yes, Admiral? Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk... Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses. Yes, lord. I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.

Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.

Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know... Like we're being watched! Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here? I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm? Right. Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.  don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior. Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great."
35,1457824468503,"Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. "
36,1480859719530,"Afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct. An Imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation.

You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. well, this could be it, sweetheart. I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm not going to argue with that. Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. Closer? Closer?! h, this is suicide! There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah. That'll do nicely. Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? I hope you know what you're doing. Yeah, me too.

Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dack. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station Three-T-Eight. We have spotted Imperial walkers! Imperial walkers on the north ridge. Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.  All right, boys, keep tight now. Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now! All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armor's too strong for blasters.

Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know... Like we're being watched! Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here? I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm? Right. Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.  don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior. Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great.

Yes, that's it. Dagobah. No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there... Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle... No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around."
37,1455536193360,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me.

Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right? Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die. Move him into position. Put him in.

Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master. You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father. Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. His lightsaber. Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.

Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. "
38,1478861568353,"Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead.

Tee chuta hhat yudd! Goodness gracious me! Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt. I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me! Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no. 

Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. 

Easy, Chewie. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! Hold it! Whoa! Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!"
39,1471018874883,"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.

There she is. See-Threepio, do you copy? For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship. We're right above you. Stand by. You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought. Nice! Come on! It's them! Blast them! Get back to the ship! Where are you going? Come back! He certainly has courage. What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! I think we took a wrong turn. There's no lock! That oughta hold it for a while. Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge. Oh, I think I just blasted it. They're coming through! Here, hold this. Here they come! For luck!

And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort... I find your lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this! Vader, release him! As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.

Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her. The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?  Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure."
40,1465051577099,"Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win."
41,1485245783206,"Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.

Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts. What's going on? Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan! What do you mean? Where is it? Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed...by the Empire!

Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now.

Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!

All wings report in. Red Ten standing by. Red Seven standing by. Red Three standing by. Red Six standing by. Red Nine standing by. Red Two standing by. Red Eleven standing by. Red Five standing by. Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through their magnetic field. Hold tight! Switch your deflectors on. Double front!"
42,1465631496922,"Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been? Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me! Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor. Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class. Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land. Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him. I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on Captain Solo."
43,1473924284638,"What are you doing hiding there? It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning, kept babbling on about his mission. Oh, no! That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir.

Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!

Stretch out with your feelings. You see, you can do it. I call it luck. In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else. Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan. You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.

He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message. What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! Luke? Luke! Come to dinner! All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.

A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in range. That's no moon! It's a space station. It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about this. Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! But there's gotta be something you can do! There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight! You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting."
44,1460507429357,"Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by."
45,1479167364724,"What is thy bidding, my Master? Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. Yes, my Master.

If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie. We have you on our screen now. Please identify. Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield. Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. Transmission commencing. Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. It'll work. It'll work. Vader's on that ship. Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know. Fly casual. I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.

I told you to remain on the command ship. A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. Yes, I know. My son is with them. Are you sure? I have felt him, my Master. Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. They are clear, my Master. Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. He will come to me? I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you andthen you will bring him before me. As you wish.

Fighters coming in. There's too many of them! Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader.

The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. Leia! Leia's my sister. Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor."
46,1483086986718,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no.

Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice. Vader. Is the dark side stronger? No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. But how am I to know the good side from the bad? You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. But tell me why I can't... No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.

Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie."
47,1465719434573,"Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back.

Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no.

No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!

Afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct. An Imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation.

You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.  I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way."
48,1474861838649,"All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!

The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. Charges! Come on, come on! Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. Freeze! You Rebel scum. 

All wings report in. Red Leader standing by. Gray Leader standing by. Green Leader standing by. Lock S-foils in attack positions. May the Force be with us. We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no reading. Are you sure? Pull up! All craft pull up! Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47."
49,1456821815948,"Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum. Those Rebels won't escape us. Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger. Right. ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations. As you wish. Lord Vader! My lord, we have them. 

All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports. Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?  The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood? Right. Okay. Good luck. Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!

Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. It's metal. Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke. It could be a speeder, one of ours. No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code. It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out. Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.

Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good.  You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.

You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.

Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way."
50,1478674669522,"What did you have in mind for your next move? Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas? No. Where are we? The Anoat system. Anoat system. There's not much there. No. 

If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish. What's going on...buddy? You're being put into carbon freeze. What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me. The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in! Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...! Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop! Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die. Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me? I love you! I know."
51,1469410419009,"Here they come! They're coming in too fast! Oooh! We've lost lateral controls. Don't worry, she'll hold together. You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don't get cocky. There are still two more of them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting!  This is all your fault.

Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.

Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? Come on! 

I'm not going anywhere. They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. But they're going to kill her! Better her than me... She's rich. Rich? Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... What? Well more wealth that you can imagine. I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! You'll get it! I better! You will..."
52,1482998880984,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.

Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!

Cut it out! I'm not gonna hurt you. Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. All right. You want something to eat? That's right. Come on. Hmmm? Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? What is it? Freeze! Come on, get up! Go get your ride and take her back to base. Yes, sir. Come on, let's get outta here.

If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance. Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have. You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it... I have it ...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia. I know. Somehow...I've always known. Then you know why I have to face him."
53,1457150972027,"What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always.

Take over! See to him! Look there! They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. Follow me! You stand guard. Come on! Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. All right.

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone."
54,1471470093881,"Oh, I told you it was dangerous here. Shall we try and go around? It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us. Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here. Quietly, there might be more of them out there. Hey... it's me. Go for help! Go! Great. Come on. Over there! Two more of them! I see them. Wait, Leia! Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch! Hey, wait! Ahhh! Move closer! Get alongside that one! Get him! Keep on that one! I'll take these two!"
55,1486150626917,"The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.

Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! Get to the top! I can't Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. Hurry! One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it! I'm trying! Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We've had some problems... Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great."
56,1481989342770,"Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must.

Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. What's going on? I don't know. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. Thank you. Okay. He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.

Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. 

Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. I can't see. Your eyesight will return in time. Where am I? Jabba's palace. Who are you? Someone who loves you. Leia! I gotta get you out of here. What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault. It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder. Look... Take him away! Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool! Bring her to me."
57,1474684246402,"Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. It is pointless to resist, my son. Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.

The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. 

The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. Leia! Leia's my sister. Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.

Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me.

Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this is Red Leader.

That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope."
60,1484191515511,"I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.

Artoo expresses his relief, also. How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark. Thanks to you. That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield. That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil. Patience. And sacrifice Han and Leia? If you honor what they fight for...yes! If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters. Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side. Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse. That boy is our last hope. No. There is another."
61,1471703586569,"Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do. No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend, hmm? I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master. Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda. You know him? Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come. Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.

Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while."
62,1468120544118,"Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there... No! wait! Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed! Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed. Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst... It's worst. There's something alive in here! That's your imagination. Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? What? Help!

Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't... What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!

He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message. What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! Luke? Luke! Come to dinner! All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.

Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir.

Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from. I saw part of the message he was... I seem to have found it."
63,1466341906051,"We don't serve their kind here! What? Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. I heartily agree with you sir. Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn't like you. I'm sorry. I don't like you either You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems. I'll be careful than. You'll be dead. This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something...

Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now.

Run, Luke! Run!

Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!

Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. Look, sir -- droids."
64,1468927157315,"The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. Leia! Leia's my sister. Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor."
65,1479422629898,"Luke, we're ready for takeoff. Good luck, Lando When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you. I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine. Princess, we'll find Han. I promise. Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal. Take care, you two. May the Force be with you. Ow!

Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch. Right, sir. Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off! Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-sevens. Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. Take care, sir. Thanks. Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right? Yeah. Be careful. You, too.Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.

Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do. No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend, hmm? I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master. Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda. You know him? Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come. Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo."
66,1471806097716,"Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move. What do you think you're doing? We're getting out of here. I knew all along it had to be a mistake. Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you? I had no choice... What are you doing? Trust him, trust him! Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice. I'm just trying to help... We don't need any of your help. H-a-a-a... What? It sounds like Han. There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform... Chewie. I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.

Distance to power generators? One-seven, decimal two-eight. Target. Maximum fire power. Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon. But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!! Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical. Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident! Wait! Wait!

You all right? Why are you still here? I heard the command center had been hit. You got your clearance to leave. Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope. Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters. Imperial troops have entered the base. Come on...that's it. Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports! K-one-zero...all troops disengage.  Oh! Wait for me! Begin retreat! Fall back!"
67,1483131293799,"Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.

Hey...hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? Three-two-six-eight-two-seven. If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here. Well, let's get moving! Where are you going? No, wait. They'll hear! Come here, you big coward! Chewie! Come here! Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay? Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me! It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this.

Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.

Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! Sorry!"

He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. But he can...

How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way."
69,1459052915063,"There's something not right here. I feel cold, death. That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go. What's in there? Only what you take with you. our weapons...you will not need them.

Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good.  You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.

Luke! Luke, don't - it's a trap! It's a trap! The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet.

This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor. Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class. Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land. Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him. I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on Captain Solo.

Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. It's metal. Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke. It could be a speeder, one of ours. No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code. It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out. Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight."
70,1475221969541,"Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one. Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.

Oh. No one to meet us. I don't like this. Well, what would you like? Well, they did let us land. Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me. See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay? Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled. How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! Inever thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?

Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you.

Artoo expresses his relief, also. How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark. Thanks to you. That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield. That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

71,1464328482355,"...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed. No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found. Lord Vader. Yes, Admiral, what is it? The Emperor commands you make contact with him. Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission. Yes, my lord.

Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. It's metal. Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke. It could be a speeder, one of ours. No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance.

Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.

The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to... No time to discuss this as a committee. I am not a committee! You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field... Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off! Look! I see it, I see it. We're doomed! The cave is collapsing. This is no cave. What?"
72,1476994096795,"No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!

Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-... Yes, sir? Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? Why not? Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger."
73,1481881662866,"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts. What's going on? Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan! What do you mean? Where is it? Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed...by the Empire!"
74,1471259525671,"What are you doing hiding there? It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning, kept babbling on about his mission. Oh, no! That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir.

How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen.

Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. But they're going to kill her! Better her than me... She's rich. Rich? Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... What? Well more wealth that you can imagine. I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! You'll get it! I better! You will...

Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? Come on! "
76,1463252131041,"Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don't know what you're talking about. You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know? 

The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone. And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil. Patience. And sacrifice Han and Leia? If you honor what they fight for...yes! If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters. Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side. Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse. That boy is our last hope. No. There is another.

Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough... I feel terrible. Why are they doing this? They never even asked me any questions. Lando. Get out of here, Lando! Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. Over to you? They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. What about Han? Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.  Vader wants us all dead. He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.

Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack. Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary. ust hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable. Dack? Dack! Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing. Rouge Three. Copy, Rouge Leader Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass. oming around, Rouge Leader."

There's something alive down there... Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle... No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around.

I don't...I don't believe it. That is why you fail."
78,1461730753456,"The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. Not for long...

Look at the size of that thing! Cut the chatter, Red Two. Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys! Red Leader, this is Gold Leader. I copy, Gold Leader. We're starting for the target shaft now. We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire. Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees. I see it. Stay low. This is Red Five, I'm going in! Luke, pull up! Are you all right? I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.

He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing."
79,1486429139051,"Look! Get him off of there! I think I got it. I got it! Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? Let's see. It's not bad. Freeze! Oh, dear. Don't move! I love you. I know. Hands up! Stand up! Stay back. Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea.

Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.

Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!"

Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.

You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

Tee chuta hhat yudd! Goodness gracious me! Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt. I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me! Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no. "
81,1469505473218,"Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above! Red Three, Red Two, pull in! Got it! Three of them coming in, twenty degrees! Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate. Pressure's steady. Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for. We're in attack position now, sir. Hold here. We're not going to attack? I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping."
82,1456956631211,"Stretch out with your feelings. You see, you can do it. I call it luck. In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else. Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan. You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.

Take over! See to him! Look there! They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. Follow me! You stand guard. Come on! Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. All right.

Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her. The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?  Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure."
83,1473599622386,"Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. 

Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you. Obi-Wan has taught you well. I will not fight you, father. You are unwise to lower your defenses. Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. There is no conflict. You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. Good. Good."

He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. But he can..."

We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no reading. Are you sure? Pull up! All craft pull up! Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.

Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must."
86,1468147602820,"Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!

Fighters coming in. There's too many of them! Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader."
87,1477122368182,"Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you.

Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. Stop that. Stop what? Stop that! My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of? Afraid? You're trembling. I'm not trembling.

I don't...I don't believe it. That is why you fail."
88,1467156530853,"Oh. No one to meet us. I don't like this. Well, what would you like? Well, they did let us land. Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me. See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay? Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled. How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! Inever thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?

The security codes has been changed! Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way. Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.

Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back.

No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!

Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack. Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary. ust hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable. Dack? Dack! Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing. Rouge Three. Copy, Rouge Leader Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass. oming around, Rouge Leader."
89,1458431482364,"The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. That's impossible, even for a computer. It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters. Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!

How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way."

Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum. Those Rebels won't escape us. Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger. Right. ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations. As you wish. Lord Vader! My lord, we have them. 

You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. well, this could be it, sweetheart. I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm not going to argue with that. Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. Closer? Closer?! h, this is suicide! There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah. That'll do nicely. Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? I hope you know what you're doing. Yeah, me too."
91,1480400455223,"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough... I feel terrible. Why are they doing this? They never even asked me any questions. Lando. Get out of here, Lando! Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. Over to you? They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. What about Han? Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.  Vader wants us all dead. He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.

All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator. Rouge Two, are you all right? Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader. We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you. Coming around. Watch that cross fire, boys. Set for position three. Steady. Stay tight and low. Hobbie, I've been hit!

92,1470575403123,"Oh, I told you it was dangerous here. Shall we try and go around? It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us. Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here. Quietly, there might be more of them out there. Hey... it's me. Go for help! Go! Great. Come on. Over there! Two more of them! I see them. Wait, Leia! Quick! Jam their comlink.

I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer."

You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me."

Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan... You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her away!

The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.

Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him?"

Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

Oh! Nice to see a familiar face. E chu ta! ow rude! That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if... Hello? How interesting. Oh, my. Who are you? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!"

Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message.

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by.

Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Proper?! It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.

He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone. And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor. Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class. Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land. Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him. I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on Captain Solo.

Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three! It's not fair! The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault! No light-speed? It's not my fault. Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield. You're going to attack them?! Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer... Shut up!

Afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct. An Imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation."

Put them back together right now. Might I have a word with you, please?

Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time.

Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. He will learn patience. Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father. Was I any different when you taught me? Hah. He is not ready. Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.

Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie.

So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down? That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever. We would be honored if you would join us. I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too."

Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not.  don't want your help. I want my lamp back.

You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. well, this could be it, sweetheart. I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm not going to argue with that. Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. Closer? Closer?! h, this is suicide! There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah.

Okay, stay sharp!

You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.

The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network."
107,1479996235941,"I don't...I don't believe it. That is why you fail.

Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando. Lando system? Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him. Thanks.

You have learned much, young one. You'll find I'm full of surprises. Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true. No! All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. Impressive...most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me."
108,1481856241374,"There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready. What? You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. No! Commence primary ignition.

Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. Okay, let's go. Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here! Is there anything I might do to help? Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! I can't believe he's gone. There wasn't anything you could have done. Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet! You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!

What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? Hey, Luke...may the Force be with you! What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.

Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification. These are not the droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your business. Move along. Move along. Move along."
109,1468206475965,"Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!

We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."
110,1475665961969,"General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.  A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you. Thank you, General.

Oh! Nice to see a familiar face. E chu ta! ow rude! That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if... Hello? How interesting. Oh, my. Who are you? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!

Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time.

Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil. Patience. And sacrifice Han and Leia? If you honor what they fight for...yes! If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters. Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side. Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse. That boy is our last hope. No. There is another.

So was I, if you'll remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. Will he finished what he begins? I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. Oh, you will be. You will be."
111,1480359416636,"You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet."
112,1456436514319,"No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian. Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain. You will not deviate from your present course. Rather touchy, aren't they? I thought you knew this person. Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that. Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven. Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me. Who's worried?

Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate! Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. All right, I'll give it a try. No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try. I can't. It's too big. Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ..not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship! You want the impossible."
113,1457209057522,"Here they come! They're coming in too fast! Oooh! We've lost lateral controls. Don't worry, she'll hold together. You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don't get cocky. There are still two more of them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting!  This is all your fault.

It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins!

Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! Sorry!

Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from. I saw part of the message he was... I seem to have found it."
114,1469246785787,"You got her warmed? Yeah, she's comin' up. No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie. Hey, are you awake? Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again. Come on, General, let's move. Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody? All set. Here we go again. All right, hang on.

Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. 

We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you.

It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny."
115,1484600769437,"Luke! You must complete the training. I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them. You must not go! But Han and Leia will die if I don't. You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate. But I can help them! I feel the Force! But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force. Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave! But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word. It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer. And that is why I have to go. Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader. You won't. Stopped they must be. On this depends. 

Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. Stop that. Stop what? Stop that! My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of? Afraid? You're trembling. I'm not trembling.

Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too? o, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive. Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive. Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...

...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed. No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found. Lord Vader. Yes, Admiral, what is it? The Emperor commands you make contact with him. Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission. Yes, my lord.

Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in. Not likely. Are the speeders ready? Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold. Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns. Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly. That's right. And my friends out in it. I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha. Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker. Then I'll see you in hell!"
116,1472763686676,"Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!

Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now. Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm? How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there? Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm? Mostly because of my father, I guess. Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm. 

Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack. Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary. ust hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable. Dack? Dack! Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing. Rouge Three. Copy, Rouge Leader Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass. oming around, Rouge Leader."
117,1459348193984,"The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. 

Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here.

We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you."
118,1476521922620,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no."
119,1471092619125,"They've coming in! Three marks at two ten. I'll take them myself! Cover me! Yes, sir. I can't maneuver! Stay on target. We're too close. Stay on target! Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this is Red Leader."
120,1460517383481,"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.

Did you find any droids? No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked. Yes, sir. I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since... Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. 

Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification. These are not the droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your business. Move along. Move along. Move along.

How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way."
121,1465925273421,"Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice. Vader. Is the dark side stronger? No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. But how am I to know the good side from the bad? You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. But tell me why I can't... No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm."
122,1460236000983,"Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you.

What did you have in mind for your next move? Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas? No. Where are we? The Anoat system. Anoat system. There's not much there. No. 

This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor. Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class. Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land. Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him. I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on Captain Solo.

Luke...Luke. Ben? You will go to the Dagobah system. Dagobah system? There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me. Ben...Ben. Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. Not much time. Ben...Ben... Hang on, kid. Dagobah system... Whew... Dagobah... This may smell bad, kid... Yoda... but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built. Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!

Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless! "
123,1479699188923,"Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year. You mean the next semester before harvest? Sure, there're more than enough droids. Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke. But it's a whole 'nother year. Look, it's only one more season. Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. Where are you going? It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.

I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures. Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead. The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally. Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough. I'm ready for anything. Come along, Artoo."
124,1465795911720,"The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand. It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.

Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe?

Have you been in many battles? Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways. Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or... 

Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? Come on! "
125,1485804570651,"Move! Move! The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it!"
126,1455339529671,"Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."
127,1472581418125,"Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!

Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move.

Luke? Luke? Luke? Have you seen Luke this morning? He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early. Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him? I think so. Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay! Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid...hit the accelerator.

It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!

What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always."
128,1483511202780,"Yes, that's it. Dagobah. No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there... Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle... No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around.

There's something not right here. I feel cold, death. That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go. What's in there? Only what you take with you. our weapons...you will not need them.

What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser... He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord.

You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.  I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.

What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?"
129,1463520318168,"Luke! You must complete the training. I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them. You must not go! But Han and Leia will die if I don't. You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate. But I can help them! I feel the Force! But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force. Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave! But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word. It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer. And that is why I have to go. Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader. You won't. Stopped they must be. On this depends. "
130,1457388026764,"Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going?

Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't... What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!

We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers! We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke, let me know when you're going in. I'm on my way in now... Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way.

Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir.

Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move."
131,1484674215158,"What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort... I find your lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this! Vader, release him! As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.

He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand. It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well."
132,1468147106401,"What is thy bidding, my master? There is a great disturbance in the Force. I have felt it. We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker. Yes, my master. He could destroy us. He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, my master.

What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?

Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.

Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me. My...! Why, you stuck up...half-witted...scruffy-looking...nerf-herder! Who's scruffy-looking? I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid? Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet? Headquarters personnel, report to command center. Take it easy. Excuse us, please."
133,1472327805593,"Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while."
134,1465911971891,"Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend."
135,1462681823459,"I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.

Easy, Chewie. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! Hold it! Whoa! Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!

Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker."
136,1482629778189,"Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil. Patience. And sacrifice Han and Leia? If you honor what they fight for...yes! If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters. Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side. Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse. That boy is our last hope. No. There is another.

You all right? Why are you still here? I heard the command center had been hit. You got your clearance to leave. Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope. Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters. Imperial troops have entered the base. Come on...that's it. Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports! K-one-zero...all troops disengage.  Oh! Wait for me! Begin retreat! Fall back!

Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners! I don't know how we're going to get out of this one. Oww! Chewie! That was no laser blast! Something hit us. Han, get up here! Come on, Chewie! Asteroids! Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one. What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field? They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they? You don't have to do this to impress me. Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one. Never tell me the odds!

What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser... He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord."
137,1462705608849,"Look at the size of that thing! Cut the chatter, Red Two. Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys! Red Leader, this is Gold Leader. I copy, Gold Leader. We're starting for the target shaft now. We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire. Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees. I see it. Stay low. This is Red Five, I'm going in! Luke, pull up! Are you all right? I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.

Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine."
138,1477780013409,"Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry. Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. 

Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star."
139,1464595784364,"Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. 

Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Yeah, sure. Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!! Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else. Hey! Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow. Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness! Do you understand anything they're saying? Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. What are you telling them? Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

Easy, Chewie. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! Hold it! Whoa! Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!

The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy. Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. What's he saying? He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.

Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above! Red Three, Red Two, pull in! Got it! Three of them coming in, twenty degrees! Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate. Pressure's steady. Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for. We're in attack position now, sir. Hold here. We're not going to attack? I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping."
140,1477495681366,"Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. Look, sir -- droids.

The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.

How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.

Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me! Pull in! Luke...pull in! Watch your back, Luke! Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in! I'm hit, but not bad. Artoo, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there. Red Six... Can you see Red Five? There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you? I can't shake him! I'm on him, Luke! Hold on! Blast it! Wedge where are you? Thanks, Wedge. Good shooting, Wedge!

We don't serve their kind here! What? Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. I heartily agree with you sir. Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn't like you. I'm sorry. I don't like you either You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems. I'll be careful than. You'll be dead. This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something..."
141,1465406127215,"Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!

Rendezvous at mark six point one. This is Red Two. Flying toward you. Red Three, standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them off for a few seconds.

Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful.

Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now."
142,1483615495445,"What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is. Well, Calrissian, did he survive? Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation. He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker. Skywalker has just landed, my lord. Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship. You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision. I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.

Admiral. Yes, Captain I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had. We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads! The visuals indicate life readings. It could mean anything. If we followed every lead... But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms. You found something? Yes, my lord. That's it. The Rebels are there. My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be... hat is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men.

The security codes has been changed! Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way. Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump."
143,1472436826405,"Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. 

Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late!

No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me.

Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!"
144,1466008609187,"How's this? Would it helped if I got out and pushed? It might. Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait. he bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade. This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.  Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See? Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it. Punch it!

Luke, we're ready for takeoff. Good luck, Lando When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you. I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine. Princess, we'll find Han. I promise. Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal. Take care, you two. May the Force be with you. Ow!"
145,1465329201710,"Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!"
146,1478286369716,"Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh! You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett. Yes, my lord. Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader."
147,1469457751609,"Fighters coming in. There's too many of them! Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader.

Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here.

Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!"
148,1457040324971,"There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They're for sale if you want them. "
149,1475984066132,"Luke! Luke! Oh, Master Luke. I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia. I hope she's alright. What, Chewie? What? Chewie! Hey, I don't get it. Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie. Chewie, wa-wait! Don't! "
150,1480206478072,"Luke...Luke. Ben? You will go to the Dagobah system. Dagobah system? There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me. Ben...Ben. Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. Not much time. Ben...Ben... Hang on, kid. Dagobah system... Whew... Dagobah... This may smell bad, kid... Yoda... but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built. Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!"
151,1478968023565,"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.

Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification. These are not the droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your business. Move along. Move along. Move along."
152,1460156501426,"Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him?

To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! Yes. We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.

How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way."
153,1472298574833,"Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her. The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?  Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure.

Where could they be? Close the blast doors! Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner, now I am the master. Only a master of evil, Darth. Your powers are weak, old man. You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station."
154,1485963239435,"You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. I can't see. Your eyesight will return in time. Where am I? Jabba's palace. Who are you? Someone who loves you. Leia! I gotta get you out of here. What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault. It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder. Look... Take him away! Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool! Bring her to me.

Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you. Obi-Wan has taught you well. I will not fight you, father. You are unwise to lower your defenses. Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. There is no conflict. You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. Good. Good."
155,1480866542802,"This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all. There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables. Mynocks? Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo! Wait a minute... All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!

Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time.

Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no.

So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down? That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever. We would be honored if you would join us. I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too.

Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh! You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett. Yes, my lord. Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader."
156,1455792777600,"Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless! 

Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh! You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett. Yes, my lord. Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader.

Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch. Right, sir. Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off! Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-sevens. Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. Take care, sir. Thanks. Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right? Yeah. Be careful. You, too.Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.

Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone. Han! Leia!  Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control. I saw...I saw a city in the clouds. Mmm. Friends you have there. They were in pain. It is the future you see. Future? Will they die? Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future. I've got to go to them. Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.

Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no."
157,1465650014794,"So was I, if you'll remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. Will he finished what he begins? I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. Oh, you will be. You will be.

What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?

Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh! You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett. Yes, my lord. Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader.

Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil. Patience. And sacrifice Han and Leia? If you honor what they fight for...yes! If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters. Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side. Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse. That boy is our last hope. No. There is another."
158,1469594643679,"I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. Oh... great! Soon you will learn to appreciate me. Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! Hmm. I wish I had your confidence. Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.

You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. Charges! Come on, come on! Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. Freeze! You Rebel scum. 

No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me.

You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. I can't see. Your eyesight will return in time. Where am I? Jabba's palace. Who are you? Someone who loves you. Leia! I gotta get you out of here. What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.

Don't be a fool! Bring her to me."
159,1461304388404,"Luke! Luke, don't - it's a trap! It's a trap! The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet."
160,1473488514621,"Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back.

Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too? o, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive. Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive. Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most..."
161,1465334407544,"Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! Oh, you did it!

Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one. Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.

This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor. Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class. Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land. Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him. I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on Captain Solo."
162,1482897681028,"Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend."
163,1463997048541,"Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three! It's not fair! The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault! No light-speed? It's not my fault. Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield. You're going to attack them?! Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer... Shut up!

So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No, not actually.

164,1480362646165,"What is thy bidding, my master? There is a great disturbance in the Force. I have felt it. We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker. Yes, my master. He could destroy us. He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, my master.

What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser... He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord.

Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!"
165,1476928285433,"Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know. Oh, switch off. Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these. Excuse me, sir. Put them back together right now. Might I have a word with you, please?

Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! Oh, you did it!

Luke. Father. Son, come with me. Ben, why didn't you tell me? Chewie! It's Vader. Luke...it is your destiny. Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
166,1476937561253,"Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord.

What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?

Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice. Vader. Is the dark side stronger? No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. But how am I to know the good side from the bad? You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. But tell me why I can't... No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm."
167,1474690265256,"Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. Look, sir -- droids.

Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!"
168,1461607943228,"And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!"
169,1461433742108,"Da Eitha! Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota... Boscka! I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee. Oh, no! Chewbacca! At last we have the mighty Chewbacca. Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. I want fifty thousand. No less. Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator. This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. Zeebuss. He agrees! Just relax for a moment. 

Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!

As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!

Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry. Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. 

Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Luke! Where's Leia? What? She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!"
170,1469515145397,"I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures. Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead. The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally. Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough. I'm ready for anything. Come along, Artoo.

I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! I can't believe he's gone. There wasn't anything you could have done. Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet! You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!

Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move.

You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. That's your uncle talking. Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?"
171,1471375054859,"The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.

All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations. So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then? That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you. Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You mean it controls your actions? Partially. But it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe?

Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine."
172,1455390936716,"You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! Yes. We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.

General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.

Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance. Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that! But who's going to fly it, kid! You? You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen... We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan. Seventeen, huh! Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four. Ninety-four. Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork. All right, we'll check it out."
173,1456244248495,"Oh! Nice to see a familiar face. E chu ta! ow rude! That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if... Hello? How interesting. Oh, my. Who are you? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!

Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie.

Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."
174,1456280639936,"Lock the door, Artoo. All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next door. I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. You watch your language!

A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in range. That's no moon! It's a space station. It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about this. Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! But there's gotta be something you can do! There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight! You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.

The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.

Wake up! Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. I have no need for a protocol droid. Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators. You could say... Do you speak Bocce? Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me...I'm as fluent in... All right shut up! I'll take this one.

Chewie! Get behind me! Get behind me! Can't get out that way. Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. See-Threepio! See-Threepio! Yes sir?  We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that? I didn't copy! I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out, all other information on your level is restricted."
175,1475181393789,"Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there... No! wait! Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed! Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed. Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst... It's worst. There's something alive in here! That's your imagination. Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? What? Help!

The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. Not for long...

What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort... I find your lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this! Vader, release him! As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.

176,1455917898685,"All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!

Move! Move! The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it!

If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie. We have you on our screen now. Please identify. Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield. Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. Transmission commencing. Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. It'll work. It'll work. Vader's on that ship. Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know. Fly casual. I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here."
177,1481182368614,"Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been? Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me! Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

You have learned much, young one. You'll find I'm full of surprises. Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true. No! All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. Impressive...most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me."

I'm not going anywhere. They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. But they're going to kill her! Better her than me... She's rich. Rich? Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... What? Well more wealth that you can imagine. I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! You'll get it! I better! You will..."
179,1468278181831,"Afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct. An Imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation.

Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them."

I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.

We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this... I'm sure. Ugh! Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

Look! Get him off of there! I think I got it. I got it! Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? Let's see. It's not bad. Freeze! Oh, dear. Don't move! I love you. I know. Hands up! Stand up! Stay back. Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea.

That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time."

Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. You fought in the Clone Wars? Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father. I wish I'd known him. He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.

There she is. See-Threepio, do you copy? For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship. We're right above you. Stand by. You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought. Nice! Come on! It's them! Blast them! Get back to the ship! Where are you going? Come back! He certainly has courage. What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! I think we took a wrong turn. There's no lock! That oughta hold it for a while. Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge. Oh, I think I just blasted it. They're coming through! Here, hold this. Here they come! For luck!

Red Leader... This is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run. I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. Stay in attack formation! The exhaust post is... marked and locked in! Switch power to front deflector screens. How many guns do you think, Gold Five. I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers. Death Star will be in range in five minutes. Switching to targeting computer. Computer's locked. Getting a signal. The guns...they've stopped! Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters."

We will test it...on Captain Solo.

Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. Stop that. Stop what? Stop that! My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of? Afraid? You're trembling. I'm not trembling.

Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. He will learn patience. Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father. Was I any different when you taught me? Hah. He is not ready. Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready."

You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view! Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.

A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.

Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.

And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.

Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it. Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.

Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don't know what you're talking about. You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know? 

Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate! Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. All right, I'll give it a try. No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try. I can't. It's too big. Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ..not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship! You want the impossible.

Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-... Yes, sir? Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? Why not? Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger."
190,1463852829434,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker."
191,1478344810258,"What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is. Well, Calrissian, did he survive? Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation. He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker. Skywalker has just landed, my lord. Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship. You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision. I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further."
192,1476795922234,"This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message. There will be no bargain. We're doomed. I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is. Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite. What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh! 

As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!"
193,1475791168113,"Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando. Lando system? Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him. Thanks.

Oh. No one to meet us. I don't like this. Well, what would you like? Well, they did let us land. Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me. See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay? Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled. How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! Inever thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?

Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back. Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?

Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil. Patience. And sacrifice Han and Leia? If you honor what they fight for...yes! If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters. Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side. Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse. That boy is our last hope. No. There is another.

Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you."
194,1470652467721,"I can't see a thing in this helmet. This is not going to work. Why didn't you say so before? I did say so before! Where are you taking this...thing? Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight. I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. Look out! We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal. What happened? Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? We're sending a squad up. Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous.  Who is this? What's your operating number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.

Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!

Wake up! Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. I have no need for a protocol droid. Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators. You could say... Do you speak Bocce? Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me...I'm as fluent in... All right shut up! I'll take this one.

Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification. These are not the droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your business. Move along. Move along. Move along."
195,1481035013559,"Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader... No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on. You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!

Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know. Oh, switch off. Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these. Excuse me, sir. Put them back together right now. Might I have a word with you, please?

Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. He will learn patience. Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father. Was I any different when you taught me? Hah. He is not ready. Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.

I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

Artoo! You be more careful. Artoo - that way! Artoo! Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken? If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy."
196,1463562153182,"Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win."
197,1485551994688,"Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. 

I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer."
198,1485716490995,"As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!"
199,1473223339748,"Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! Oh, you did it!

What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser... He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord."
200,1456602772800,"Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!

This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this. Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me. Yes, my Lord. The Emperor has been expecting you. I know, father. So, you have accepted the truth. I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. That name no longer has any meaning for me.

Da Eitha! Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota... Boscka! I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee. Oh, no! Chewbacca! At last we have the mighty Chewbacca. Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. I want fifty thousand. No less. Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator. This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. Zeebuss. He agrees! Just relax for a moment. "
201,1464848661627,"No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. You fought in the Clone Wars? Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father. I wish I'd known him. He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.

Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move."
202,1469574110314,"All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!

Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!"
203,1478641069630,"Artoo expresses his relief, also. How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark. Thanks to you. That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield. That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move. What do you think you're doing? We're getting out of here. I knew all along it had to be a mistake. Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you? I had no choice... What are you doing? Trust him, trust him! Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice. I'm just trying to help... We don't need any of your help. H-a-a-a... What? It sounds like Han. There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform... Chewie. I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.

Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one. Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.

I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain."
204,1456265337089,"Yes, Admiral? Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk... Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses. Yes, lord. I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.

Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back."
205,1481360096960,"Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. What's going on? I don't know. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. Thank you. Okay. He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.

What is thy bidding, my Master? Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. Yes, my Master."
206,1483088386688,"What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!

Luke? Lord Vader has set a trap for him. And we're the bait. Well, he's on his way. Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?  My friend! Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems. Yeah, you're a real hero. You certainly have a way with people.

What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is. Well, Calrissian, did he survive? Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation. He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker. Skywalker has just landed, my lord. Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship. You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision. I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further."
207,1477034182048,"Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must.

The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. Charges! Come on, come on! Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. Freeze! You Rebel scum. 

This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message. There will be no bargain. We're doomed. I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is. Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite. What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh! "
208,1467999814710,"Well, look at you, a general, huh? Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack. I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.

No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me."
209,1476777934081,"Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Yeah, sure. Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!! Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else. Hey! Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow. Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness! Do you understand anything they're saying? Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. What are you telling them? Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. 

Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!

Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above! Red Three, Red Two, pull in! Got it! Three of them coming in, twenty degrees! Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate. Pressure's steady. Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for. We're in attack position now, sir. Hold here. We're not going to attack? I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping."
210,1468250926982,"As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!

Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late!

That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time."
211,1460874616522,"Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield. Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector. Good. Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control....Fire! The first transport is away.

I don't...I don't believe it. That is why you fail."
212,1476847149153,"Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. Stop that. Stop what? Stop that! My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of? Afraid? You're trembling. I'm not trembling."
213,1484339232880,"All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator. Rouge Two, are you all right? Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader. We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you. Coming around. Watch that cross fire, boys. Set for position three. Steady. Stay tight and low. Hobbie, I've been hit!

But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not.  don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah! Oh, Artoo, let him have it. Mine! Mine! Artoo! Mine! Mine!"
214,1481083524062,"It's a trap!

Well, look at you, a general, huh? Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack. I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.

It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge."
215,1456523737974,"Oh. No one to meet us. I don't like this. Well, what would you like? Well, they did let us land. Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me. See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay? Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled. How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! Inever thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?

Artoo! You be more careful. Artoo - that way! Artoo! Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken? If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy.

The security codes has been changed! Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way. Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump."
216,1483683236200,"Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate! Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. All right, I'll give it a try. No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try. I can't. It's too big. Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ..not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship! You want the impossible.

Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch. Right, sir. Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off! Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-sevens. Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. Take care, sir. Thanks. Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right? Yeah. Be careful. You, too.Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.

But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get your ship out?

217,1471931824163,"Luke, we're ready for takeoff. Good luck, Lando When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you. I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine. Princess, we'll find Han. I promise. Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal. Take care, you two. May the Force be with you. Ow!

How's this? Would it helped if I got out and pushed? It might. Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait. he bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade. This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.  Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See? Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it. Punch it!

Yes, Admiral? Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk... Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses. Yes, lord. I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.

I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

Yes, that's it. Dagobah. No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there... Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle... No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around."
218,1467224871467,"Luke? Lord Vader has set a trap for him. And we're the bait. Well, he's on his way. Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?  My friend! Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems. Yeah, you're a real hero. You certainly have a way with people."
219,1464658793665,"Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.

You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.

Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?"
220,1478375767676,"Are they away? They have just made the jump into hyperspace. You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.

Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine."
221,1465678608478,"Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.

Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master. You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father. Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. His lightsaber. Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.

The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

What is thy bidding, my Master? Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. Yes, my Master."
222,1470934551131,"Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while."
223,1473069038171,"Easy, Chewie. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! Hold it! Whoa! Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!"

Have you been in many battles? Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways. Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or... "
225,1482583989842,"Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know. Oh, switch off. Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these. Excuse me, sir. Put them back together right now. Might I have a word with you, please?

I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

Luke? Lord Vader has set a trap for him. And we're the bait. Well, he's on his way. Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?  My friend! Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems. Yeah, you're a real hero. You certainly have a way with people.

Afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct. An Imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation."
226,1463600114990,"What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser... He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord.

Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch. Right, sir. Okay, that's it. Try it...Off!

Leia's my sister. Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.

Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must.

Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker."
228,1464907948821,"Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station! The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.... The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station."

I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say? I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. Leia! Oh! Your Royal Highness. But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free. Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly -- Just tell them. You see, Master Luke they didn't believe me. Just as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. Thanks, Threepio. I...I never knew I had it in me.

Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here.

Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above! Red Three, Red Two, pull in! Got it! Three of them coming in, twenty degrees! Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate. Pressure's steady. Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for. We're in attack position now, sir. Hold here. We're not going to attack? I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping."
230,1459822534671,"Stretch out with your feelings. You see, you can do it. I call it luck. In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else. Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan. You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.

Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir.

What are you doing hiding there? It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning, kept babbling on about his mission. Oh, no! That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir.

It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins!"

We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no reading. Are you sure? Pull up! All craft pull up! Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.

We've got to give him more time.

Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point-blank range. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. She's gonna blow! I'm hit!

That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. "

I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord.

Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good.  You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.

Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!

I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful! Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow! Leia! Go! I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better.

Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you."

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You mean it controls your actions? Partially. But it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations. So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then? That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you. Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them."
239,1459686137699,"Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.

All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. Charges! Come on, come on! Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. Freeze! You Rebel scum. "
240,1464886544423,"All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this. All right. What's your plan? Uh...Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you. Okay. Han, you put these on. Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind. Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking...but, ah...what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here? Lock the door! And hope they don't have blasters. That isn't very reassuring.

Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. That's what I'm afraid of.

The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine."
241,1471969692720,"Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate! Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. All right, I'll give it a try. No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try. I can't. It's too big. Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ..not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship! You want the impossible.

Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord.

Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in. Not likely. Are the speeders ready? Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold. Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns. Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly. That's right. And my friends out in it. I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha. Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker. Then I'll see you in hell!

Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.

Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dack. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station Three-T-Eight. We have spotted Imperial walkers! Imperial walkers on the north ridge. Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.  All right, boys, keep tight now. Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now! All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armor's too strong for blasters."
242,1479774862546,"Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. 

We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you.

You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie. We have you on our screen now. Please identify. Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield. Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. Transmission commencing. Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. It'll work. It'll work. Vader's on that ship. Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know. Fly casual. I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here."
243,1458967075574,"Luke! Luke, don't - it's a trap! It's a trap! The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet."
244,1477391145268,"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. 

What is thy bidding, my Master? Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. Yes, my Master.

What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?"
246,1456018011275,"How long before you can make the jump to light speed? It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer. Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining... Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? What's that flashing? We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed."
247,1455468944130,"You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. well, this could be it, sweetheart. I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm not going to argue with that. Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. Closer? Closer?! h, this is suicide! There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah. That'll do nicely. Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? I hope you know what you're doing. Yeah, me too.

How's this? Would it helped if I got out and pushed? It might. Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait. he bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade. This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.  Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See? Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it. Punch it!

Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while."
248,1460657012748,"Apology accepted, Captain Needa. Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now. Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory. Yes, my lord. We'll find them. Don't fail me again, Admiral. Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet."
249,1464457237487,"The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone. And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.

Admiral. Yes, Captain I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had. We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads! The visuals indicate life readings. It could mean anything. If we followed every lead... But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms. You found something? Yes, my lord. That's it. The Rebels are there. My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be... hat is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men."
250,1455683773733,"I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say? I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. Leia! Oh! Your Royal Highness. But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free. Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly -- Just tell them. You see, Master Luke they didn't believe me. Just as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. Thanks, Threepio. I...I never knew I had it in me.

The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. 

If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision. Father, please. Help me. Now, young Skywalker...you will die.

We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you."
251,1472287089398,"Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there... No! wait! Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed! Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed. Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst... It's worst. There's something alive in here! That's your imagination. Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? What? Help!"
252,1473111735320,"What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? Hey, Luke...may the Force be with you! What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.

They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you...always! Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil? Ben is a great man. Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. I didn't hear you give any ideas... Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up... Who do you think... 

The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. That's impossible, even for a computer. It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters. Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!

Take over! See to him! Look there! They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. Follow me! You stand guard. Come on! Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. All right.

It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins!"
253,1485177980208,"Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you."
254,1457818145777,"Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!

Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!"
255,1486300319861,"Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! Get to the top! I can't Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. Hurry! One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it! I'm trying! Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We've had some problems... Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great.

Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. That's what I'm afraid of.

Did you find any droids? No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked. Yes, sir. I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since... Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. 

Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. Okay, let's go. Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here! Is there anything I might do to help? Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on."
256,1480849299688,"What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is. Well, Calrissian, did he survive? Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation. He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker. Skywalker has just landed, my lord. Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship. You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision. I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.

Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dack. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station Three-T-Eight. We have spotted Imperial walkers! Imperial walkers on the north ridge. Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.  All right, boys, keep tight now. Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now! All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armor's too strong for blasters.

Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando. Lando system? Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him. Thanks.

Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."

Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message. What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! Luke? Luke! Come to dinner! All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.

We don't serve their kind here! What? Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. I heartily agree with you sir. Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn't like you. I'm sorry. I don't like you either You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems. I'll be careful than. You'll be dead. This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something...

We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."
258,1467004680517,"Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. 

Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck. You, too.

It's a trap!"
259,1466477674059,"And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!

I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. 

Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir."
260,1466604320791,"There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They're for sale if you want them. 

They've coming in! Three marks at two ten. I'll take them myself! Cover me! Yes, sir. I can't maneuver! Stay on target. We're too close. Stay on target! Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this is Red Leader.

Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't... What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!

Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now."
261,1484406541625,"As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!

Good luck. You're gonna need it. General Madine. We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator. Sounds dangerous. I wonder who they found to pull that off. General Solo, is your strike team assembled? Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Rawwwrr! Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one. Uh, General... count me in. I'm with you, too! What is it? Ask me again sometime. Luke. Hi, Han... Chewie. Exciting is hardly the word I would use.

Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right? Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die. Move him into position. Put him in.

Fighters coming in. There's too many of them! Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader.

We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this... I'm sure. Ugh! Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me."
262,1464283408066,"Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move.

General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.

The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. Not for long..."
263,1485546547160,"Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!

Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.

Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point-blank range. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. She's gonna blow! I'm hit!

You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not? I am See-Threepio, human-cy... Yes or no will do. Oh. Well, yes. How many languages do you speak? I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him. Disintegrated? Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber. Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh! You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely. "
264,1479705998634,"Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. 

Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Proper?! It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.

It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge.

Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. "
265,1475412420681,"Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready. You'll have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort... I find your lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this! Vader, release him! As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.

All wings report in. Red Ten standing by. Red Seven standing by. Red Three standing by. Red Six standing by. Red Nine standing by. Red Two standing by. Red Eleven standing by. Red Five standing by. Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through their magnetic field. Hold tight! Switch your deflectors on. Double front!

Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. What's this? What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that? Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Who is she? She's beautiful. I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi... I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to... Is there more to this recording? Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.

Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe?"
266,1473916497871,"It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge.

Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead."
267,1474730850874,"Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!"
268,1480825633126,"Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die.

Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. 

Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you. Obi-Wan has taught you well. I will not fight you, father. You are unwise to lower your defenses. Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. There is no conflict. You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. Good. Good.

As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!"
269,1481778289641,"Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know... Like we're being watched! Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here? I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm? Right. Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.  don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior. Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great.

You all right? Why are you still here? I heard the command center had been hit. You got your clearance to leave. Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope. Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters. Imperial troops have entered the base. Come on...that's it. Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports! K-one-zero...all troops disengage.  Oh! Wait for me! Begin retreat! Fall back!

So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down? That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever. We would be honored if you would join us. I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too.

Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum. Those Rebels won't escape us. Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger. Right. ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations. As you wish. Lord Vader! My lord, we have them. 

Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back."
270,1470391527094,"I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice. Vader. Is the dark side stronger? No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. But how am I to know the good side from the bad? You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. But tell me why I can't... No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.

You all right? Why are you still here? I heard the command center had been hit. You got your clearance to leave. Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.

271,1473827503009,"Chewie! Get behind me! Get behind me! Can't get out that way. Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. See-Threepio! See-Threepio! Yes sir?  We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that? I didn't copy! I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out, all other information on your level is restricted.

Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner. But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters... You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it! All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go. Uncle Owen... Yeah?This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look! Hey, what're you trying to push on us? Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain. Uncle Owen... Yeah? What about that one? What about that blue one? We'll take that one. Yeah, take it away.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You mean it controls your actions? Partially. But it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them."
272,1479883043103,"Look! Get him off of there! I think I got it. I got it! Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? Let's see. It's not bad. Freeze! Oh, dear. Don't move! I love you. I know. Hands up! Stand up! Stay back. Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea.

You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted.

General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!

If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie. We have you on our screen now. Please identify. Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield. Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. Transmission commencing. Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. It'll work. It'll work. Vader's on that ship. Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know. Fly casual. I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.

It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge."
273,1464460114905,"Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know. Oh, switch off. Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these. Excuse me, sir. Put them back together right now. Might I have a word with you, please?"
274,1468098704787,"Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by."
275,1479234414032,"Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.

Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. 

Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead.

Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Luke! Where's Leia? What? She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!"
276,1485869069198,"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too? o, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive. Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive. Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...

Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. It's metal. Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke. It could be a speeder, one of ours. No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code. It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out. Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.

Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been? Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me! Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.

You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up. Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right. Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo. Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope. Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed. Close the doors. Yes, sir."
277,1464612092668,"There's something not right here. I feel cold, death. That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go. What's in there? Only what you take with you. our weapons...you will not need them.

I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.

I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good.  You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful."
278,1471752945397,"There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They're for sale if you want them. 

Hey...hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? Three-two-six-eight-two-seven. If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here. Well, let's get moving! Where are you going? No, wait. They'll hear! Come here, you big coward! Chewie! Come here! Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay? Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me! It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this.

Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now."
279,1455894096006,"Have you been in many battles? Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways. Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or... 

What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always.

Take over! See to him! Look there! They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. Follow me! You stand guard. Come on! Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. All right."
280,1484940367905,"Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move. What do you think you're doing? We're getting out of here. I knew all along it had to be a mistake. Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you? I had no choice... What are you doing? Trust him, trust him! Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice. I'm just trying to help... We don't need any of your help. H-a-a-a... What? It sounds like Han. There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform... Chewie. I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.

Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.

All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator. Rouge Two, are you all right? Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader. We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you. Coming around. Watch that cross fire, boys. Set for position three. Steady. Stay tight and low. Hobbie, I've been hit!"
281,1468811285246,"I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.

Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh! You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett. Yes, my lord. Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader.

No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian. Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain. You will not deviate from your present course. Rather touchy, aren't they? I thought you knew this person. Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that. Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven. Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me. Who's worried?

Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! Oh, you did it!

Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no."
282,1482327738202,"Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi.

We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you.

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by."
283,1461918048361,"Echo Base...I've got something! Not much, but it could be a life form. This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two. Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by. Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found them. Repeat, I found them. Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again.

This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor. Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class. Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land. Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him. I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on Captain Solo.

Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time.

What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!"
284,1481352053824,"Admiral. Yes, Captain I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had. We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads! The visuals indicate life readings. It could mean anything. If we followed every lead... But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms. You found something? Yes, my lord. That's it. The Rebels are there. My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be... hat is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men.

You have learned much, young one. You'll find I'm full of surprises. Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true. No! All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. Impressive...most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me.

Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. He will learn patience. Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father. Was I any different when you taught me? Hah. He is not ready. Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready."
285,1458381456586,"You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet."
286,1464360687419,"Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. Stop that. Stop what? Stop that! My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of? Afraid? You're trembling. I'm not trembling."
287,1468583518579,"Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!

Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! Sorry!

Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move."
288,1466856185189,"If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance. Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have. You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it... I have it ...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia. I know. Somehow...I've always known. Then you know why I have to face him."
289,1457554278564,"Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know. Oh, switch off. Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these. Excuse me, sir. Put them back together right now. Might I have a word with you, please?

Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."
290,1472543884258,"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. What's this? What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that? Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Who is she? She's beautiful. I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi... I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to... Is there more to this recording? Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.

Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me! Pull in! Luke...pull in! Watch your back, Luke! Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in! I'm hit, but not bad. Artoo, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there. Red Six... Can you see Red Five? There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you? I can't shake him! I'm on him, Luke! Hold on! Blast it! Wedge where are you? Thanks, Wedge. Good shooting, Wedge!

You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. That's your uncle talking. Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?"

Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!

How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.

How long before you can make the jump to light speed? It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer. Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining... Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? What's that flashing? We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.

Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?"

Lock the door, Artoo. All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next door. I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. You watch your language!

Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.

Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her. The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?  Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure."

Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We've had some problems... Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great.

There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready. What? You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. No! Commence primary ignition.

My scope's negative. I don't see anything. Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up. Biggs! You've picked one up...watch it! I can't see it! Where is he?! He's on me tight, I can't shake him...I can't shake him. Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in. Got him!

Close up formation. You'd better let her loose. Almost there! I can't hold them! It's away! It's a hit! Negative. Negative! It didn't go in. It just impacted on the surface. Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to point... oh-five, we'll cover for you. Stay there... I just lost my starboard engine. Get set to make your attack run."

He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message.

Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.

No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late!

This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this. Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me. Yes, my Lord. The Emperor has been expecting you. I know, father. So, you have accepted the truth. I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. That name no longer has any meaning for me.

Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck. You, too."

Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from. I saw part of the message he was... I seem to have found it.

Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going?

Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!"
299,1480156513216,"Artoo? Artoo! Where are you?

Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. He will learn patience. Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father. Was I any different when you taught me? Hah. He is not ready. Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.

Luke? Lord Vader has set a trap for him. And we're the bait. Well, he's on his way. Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?  My friend! Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems. Yeah, you're a real hero. You certainly have a way with people.

Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move. What do you think you're doing? We're getting out of here. I knew all along it had to be a mistake. Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you? I had no choice... What are you doing? Trust him, trust him! Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice. I'm just trying to help... We don't need any of your help. H-a-a-a... What? It sounds like Han. There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform... Chewie. I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee."
300,1485237907297,"So was I, if you'll remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. Will he finished what he begins? I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. Oh, you will be. You will be.

Distance to power generators? One-seven, decimal two-eight. Target. Maximum fire power. Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon. But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!! Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical. Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident! Wait! Wait!

Luke! You must complete the training. I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them. You must not go! But Han and Leia will die if I don't. You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate. But I can help them! I feel the Force! But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force. Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave! But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word. It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer. And that is why I have to go. Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader. You won't. Stopped they must be. On this depends. 

They're moving to attack position. Shields up! Track them. They may come around for another pass. Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. hey can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device. Well, there's no trace of them, sir. Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit. Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area. Yes, Captain Needa.

Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! Oh, you did it!"
301,1471832408288,"Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend."

I don't...I don't believe it. That is why you fail.

Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie."
303,1458099731362,"So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down? That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever. We would be honored if you would join us. I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too."
304,1455438863445,"Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance. Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that! But who's going to fly it, kid! You? You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen... We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan. Seventeen, huh! Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four. Ninety-four. Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork. All right, we'll check it out.

The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. Not for long...

No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. You fought in the Clone Wars? Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father. I wish I'd known him. He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.

He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand. It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.

Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! Get to the top! I can't Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. Hurry! One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it! I'm trying! Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We've had some problems... Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great."
305,1476323654622,"They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you...always! Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil? Ben is a great man. Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. I didn't hear you give any ideas... Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up... Who do you think... "
306,1475950376985,"Apology accepted, Captain Needa. Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now. Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory. Yes, my lord. We'll find them. Don't fail me again, Admiral. Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.

Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don't know what you're talking about. You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know? 

Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate! Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. All right, I'll give it a try. No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try. I can't. It's too big. Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ..not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship! You want the impossible.

Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough... I feel terrible. Why are they doing this? They never even asked me any questions. Lando. Get out of here, Lando! Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. Over to you? They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. What about Han? Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.  Vader wants us all dead. He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.

So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.

They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too."
307,1478877727651,"Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!

The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. "
308,1461257232200,"There's something not right here. I feel cold, death. That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go. What's in there? Only what you take with you. our weapons...you will not need them."
309,1483346902366,"I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures. Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead. The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally. Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough. I'm ready for anything. Come along, Artoo.

Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. Easy...you call that easy? Their tracking us! Not this ship, sister. At least the information in Artoo is still intact. What's so important? What's he carrying? The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet! It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money! You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!

Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now."
310,1486383913098,"Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!

Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Yeah, sure. Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!! Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else. Hey! Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow. Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness! Do you understand anything they're saying? Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. What are you telling them? Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!

Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here.

Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star."
311,1472532054674,"Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone. Han! Leia!  Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control. I saw...I saw a city in the clouds. Mmm. Friends you have there. They were in pain. It is the future you see. Future? Will they die? Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future. I've got to go to them. Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.

Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know. Oh, switch off. Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these. Excuse me, sir. Put them back together right now. Might I have a word with you, please?

Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate! Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?

Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord."
312,1462918383790,"Run, Luke! Run!

Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.

This place can be a little rough. I'm ready for anything. Come along, Artoo.

It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins!"
313,1471560549587,"Fighters coming in. There's too many of them! Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader.

We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you."
314,1475216712575,"Have you been in many battles? Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways. Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or... 

Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him?"
315,1483375094407,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no."
316,1458869025400,"Afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct. An Imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation.

Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!

Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh! You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett. Yes, my lord. Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader.

What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is. Well, Calrissian, did he survive? Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation. He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker. Skywalker has just landed, my lord. Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship. You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision. I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.

Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while."
317,1456883657172,"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.

Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.

If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!

The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.

Are they away? They have just made the jump into hyperspace. You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.

Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir."
318,1456341854316,"That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point-blank range. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. She's gonna blow! I'm hit!"
319,1467893215522,"Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice. Vader. Is the dark side stronger? No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. But how am I to know the good side from the bad? You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. But tell me why I can't... No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.

Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good.  You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful."
320,1455645570837,"If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance. Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have. You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it... I have it ...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia. I know. Somehow...I've always known. Then you know why I have to face him.

Easy, Chewie. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! Hold it! Whoa! Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!

Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Proper?! It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine."
321,1474795762192,"Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! Oh!! Luke! Luke! Grab him! What happened? I've got a very bad feeling about this. The walls are moving! Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something. Wait a minute! Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?"
322,1463479685606,"Artoo? Artoo! Where are you?"
323,1461414332690,"Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been? Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me! Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

Luke. Father. Son, come with me. Ben, why didn't you tell me? Chewie! It's Vader. Luke...it is your destiny. Ben, why didn't you tell me?

There's something not right here. I feel cold, death. That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go. What's in there? Only what you take with you. our weapons...you will not need them.

Apology accepted, Captain Needa. Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now. Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory. Yes, my lord. We'll find them. Don't fail me again, Admiral. Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.

Luke! Luke, don't - it's a trap! It's a trap! The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet."
324,1459388341595,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.

That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. I can't see. Your eyesight will return in time. Where am I? Jabba's palace. Who are you? Someone who loves you. Leia! I gotta get you out of here. What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault. It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder. Look... Take him away! Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool! Bring her to me."
325,1472267147466,"Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!

Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.

Artoo! You be more careful. Artoo - that way! Artoo! Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken? If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy.

Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now. Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm? How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there? Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm? Mostly because of my father, I guess. Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm. 

Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while."
326,1477193427714,"I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful! Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow! Leia! Go! I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better.

Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum. Those Rebels won't escape us. Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger. Right. ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations. As you wish. Lord Vader! My lord, we have them. 

Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.

You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.  I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.

Oh. No one to meet us. I don't like this. Well, what would you like? Well, they did let us land. Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me. See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay? Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled. How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! Inever thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?"
327,1455178852120,"Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know. Oh, switch off. Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these. Excuse me, sir. Put them back together right now. Might I have a word with you, please?

Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-... Yes, sir? Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? Why not? Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.

They're moving to attack position. Shields up! Track them. They may come around for another pass. Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. hey can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device. Well, there's no trace of them, sir. Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit. Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area. Yes, Captain Needa.

Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time.

Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum. Those Rebels won't escape us. Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger. Right. ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations. As you wish. Lord Vader! My lord, we have them. "
328,1479485131279,"Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

I don't...I don't believe it. That is why you fail.

Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum. Those Rebels won't escape us. Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger. Right. ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations. As you wish. Lord Vader! My lord, we have them. 

The security codes has been changed! Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way. Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.

Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back."
329,1456966505234,"You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. well, this could be it, sweetheart. I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm not going to argue with that. Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. Closer? Closer?! h, this is suicide! There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah. That'll do nicely. Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? I hope you know what you're doing. Yeah, me too.

Yes, Admiral? Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk... Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses. Yes, lord. I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.

Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dack. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station Three-T-Eight. We have spotted Imperial walkers! Imperial walkers on the north ridge. Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.  All right, boys, keep tight now. Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now! All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armor's too strong for blasters.

They're moving to attack position. Shields up! Track them. They may come around for another pass. Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. hey can't have disappeared.

330,1472165337469,"Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.

Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. It is pointless to resist, my son. Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive."
331,1464966303694,"Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master. You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father. Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. His lightsaber. Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.

All wings report in. Red Leader standing by. Gray Leader standing by. Green Leader standing by. Lock S-foils in attack positions. May the Force be with us. We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no reading. Are you sure? Pull up! All craft pull up! Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. Oh... great! Soon you will learn to appreciate me. Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! Hmm. I wish I had your confidence. Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.

Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Luke! Where's Leia? What? She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!

Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!"
332,1456287652866,"Da Eitha! Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota... Boscka! I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee. Oh, no! Chewbacca! At last we have the mighty Chewbacca. Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. I want fifty thousand. No less. Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator. This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. Zeebuss. He agrees! Just relax for a moment. 

You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

Look! Get him off of there! I think I got it. I got it! Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? Let's see. It's not bad. Freeze! Oh, dear. Don't move! I love you. I know. Hands up! Stand up! Stay back. Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea.

Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you. Obi-Wan has taught you well. I will not fight you, father. You are unwise to lower your defenses. Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. There is no conflict. You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. Good. Good."
333,1478699757492,"Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield. The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed. We're starting our approach. Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived. Yes, sir.

I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.

Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point-blank range. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. She's gonna blow! I'm hit!"
334,1471168422171,"Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back. Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?

Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch. Right, sir. Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off! Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-sevens. Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. Take care, sir. Thanks. Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right? Yeah. Be careful. You, too.Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.

Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord.

You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. well, this could be it, sweetheart. I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm not going to argue with that. Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. Closer? Closer?! h, this is suicide! There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah. That'll do nicely. Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? I hope you know what you're doing. Yeah, me too.

Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. He will learn patience. Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father. Was I any different when you taught me? Hah. He is not ready. Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready."
335,1459230239430,"Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here.

Cut it out! I'm not gonna hurt you. Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. All right. You want something to eat? That's right. Come on. Hmmm? Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? What is it? Freeze! Come on, get up! Go get your ride and take her back to base. Yes, sir. Come on, let's get outta here.

Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi.

Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Luke! Where's Leia? What? She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!"
336,1474862572627,"What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?

Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you.

I don't...I don't believe it. That is why you fail.

Luke...Luke. Ben? You will go to the Dagobah system. Dagobah system? There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me. Ben...Ben. Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. Not much time. Ben...Ben... Hang on, kid. Dagobah system... Whew... Dagobah... This may smell bad, kid... Yoda... but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built. Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!"
337,1456339293654,"Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.

Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.

Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. That's what I'm afraid of.

This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs. I don't like the look of this. Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo? Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. What is it? Some kind of local trouble? Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements."
338,1485212853750,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me.

Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!

Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.

Look! Get him off of there! I think I got it. I got it! Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? Let's see. It's not bad. Freeze! Oh, dear. Don't move! I love you. I know. Hands up! Stand up! Stay back. Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea.

Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right? Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die. Move him into position. Put him in."
339,1476935145894,"They've coming in! Three marks at two ten. I'll take them myself! Cover me! Yes, sir. I can't maneuver! Stay on target. We're too close. Stay on target! Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this is Red Leader.

Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her. The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?  Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure.

Hey...hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? Three-two-six-eight-two-seven. If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here. Well, let's get moving! Where are you going? No, wait. They'll hear! Come here, you big coward! Chewie! Come here! Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay? Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me! It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this.

Take over! See to him! Look there! They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. Follow me! You stand guard. Come on! Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. All right."
340,1483606378251,"The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network."
341,1463290535677,"Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie."

Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me.

Luke! Luke! Oh, Master Luke. I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia. I hope she's alright. What, Chewie? What? Chewie! Hey, I don't get it. Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie. Chewie, wa-wait! Don't! 

The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. "
343,1473949537240,"What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always."
344,1485343745445,"The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two.

345,1482314616385,"Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.

Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me. My...! Why, you stuck up...half-witted...scruffy-looking...nerf-herder! Who's scruffy-looking? I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid? Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet? Headquarters personnel, report to command center. Take it easy. Excuse us, please."
346,1464874123978,"Learn about the Force, Luke. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You must do what you feel is right, of course.

You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

He is here... Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Surely he must be dead by now. Don't underestimate the power of the Force. The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. Yes. Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty-three. The princess! Put all sections on alert!"
347,1480920289236,"Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield. Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector. Good. Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control....Fire! The first transport is away."
348,1483580871619,"As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!

Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right? Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die. Move him into position. Put him in."
349,1484756455071,"Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck. You, too.

All wings report in. Red Leader standing by. Gray Leader standing by. Green Leader standing by. Lock S-foils in attack positions. May the Force be with us. We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no reading. Are you sure? Pull up! All craft pull up! Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance. Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have. You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it... I have it ...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia. I know. Somehow...I've always known. Then you know why I have to face him.

Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above! Red Three, Red Two, pull in! Got it! Three of them coming in, twenty degrees! Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate. Pressure's steady. Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for. We're in attack position now, sir. Hold here. We're not going to attack? I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping."
350,1459353712187,"Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification. These are not the droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your business. Move along. Move along. Move along.

Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from. I saw part of the message he was... I seem to have found it.

It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...I never heard of them hitting anything this big before. They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers. These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise. Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home! Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous. Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!"
351,1455531869098,"I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say? I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. Leia! Oh! Your Royal Highness. But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free. Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly -- Just tell them. You see, Master Luke they didn't believe me. Just as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. Thanks, Threepio. I...I never knew I had it in me.

Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend."
352,1472186533820,"Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it. Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.

Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader... No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on. You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!

Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back."
353,1476421733394,"Red Leader... This is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run. I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. Stay in attack formation! The exhaust post is... marked and locked in! Switch power to front deflector screens. How many guns do you think, Gold Five. I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers. Death Star will be in range in five minutes. Switching to targeting computer. Computer's locked. Getting a signal. The guns...they've stopped! Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.

Learn about the Force, Luke. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You must do what you feel is right, of course.

Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready. You'll have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. That's what I'm afraid of."
354,1457507597752,"Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. 

It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny.

If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision. Father, please. Help me. Now, young Skywalker...you will die."
355,1480307342197,"Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."
356,1470616684341,"Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.

The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!

Chewie! Get behind me! Get behind me! Can't get out that way. Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. See-Threepio! See-Threepio! Yes sir?  We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that? I didn't copy! I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out, all other information on your level is restricted."
357,1479191906501,"Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack. Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary. ust hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable. Dack? Dack! Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing. Rouge Three. Copy, Rouge Leader Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass. oming around, Rouge Leader.

All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator. Rouge Two, are you all right? Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader. We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you. Coming around. Watch that cross fire, boys. Set for position three. Steady. Stay tight and low. Hobbie, I've been hit!

Distance to power generators? One-seven, decimal two-eight. Target. Maximum fire power. Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon. But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!! Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical. Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident! Wait! Wait!

Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them."

Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. Impressive...most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me.

Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless! "

363,1476729081351,"Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!

You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. I can't see. Your eyesight will return in time. Where am I? Jabba's palace. Who are you? Someone who loves you. Leia! I gotta get you out of here. What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault. It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder. Look... Take him away! Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool! Bring her to me."
364,1485243441113,"Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dack. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station Three-T-Eight. We have spotted Imperial walkers! Imperial walkers on the north ridge. Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.  All right, boys, keep tight now. Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now! All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armor's too strong for blasters."
365,1476020440059,"No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. You fought in the Clone Wars? Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father. I wish I'd known him. He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.

Rendezvous at mark six point one. This is Red Two. Flying toward you. Red Three, standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them off for a few seconds.

Chewie! Get behind me! Get behind me! Can't get out that way. Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. See-Threepio! See-Threepio! Yes sir?  We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that? I didn't copy! I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out, all other information on your level is restricted.

I'm not going anywhere. They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. But they're going to kill her! Better her than me... She's rich. Rich? Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... What? Well more wealth that you can imagine. I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! You'll get it! I better! You will..."
366,1455240440277,"You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! Yes. We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.

I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures. Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead. The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally. Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough. I'm ready for anything. Come along, Artoo.

Did you find any droids? No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked. Yes, sir. I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since... Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. 

The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network."
367,1468576967588,"Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back.

All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator. Rouge Two, are you all right? Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader. We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you. Coming around. Watch that cross fire, boys. Set for position three. Steady. Stay tight and low. Hobbie, I've been hit!

Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know. Oh, switch off. Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these. Excuse me, sir. Put them back together right now. Might I have a word with you, please?

How's this? Would it helped if I got out and pushed? It might. Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait. he bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade. This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.  Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See? Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it. Punch it!

I don't...I don't believe it. That is why you fail."
368,1484332530206,"Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi."
369,1476383126613,"Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield. The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed. We're starting our approach. Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived. Yes, sir.

Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late!

Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!"
370,1461647695412,"I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful! Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow! Leia! Go! I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better.

Apology accepted, Captain Needa. Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now. Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory. Yes, my lord. We'll find them. Don't fail me again, Admiral. Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet."
371,1478290501580,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish. What's going on...buddy? You're being put into carbon freeze. What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me. The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in! Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...! Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop! Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die. Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me? I love you! I know.

You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.  I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.

The security codes has been changed! Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way. Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.

Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. He will learn patience. Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father. Was I any different when you taught me? Hah. He is not ready. Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready."
372,1459984042078,"All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!

Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Proper?! It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.

Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. What's going on? I don't know. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. Thank you. Okay. He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day."
373,1476096709874,"Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead.

Easy, Chewie. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! Hold it! Whoa! Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!"
374,1480834542550,"I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say? I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. Leia! Oh! Your Royal Highness. But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free. Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly -- Just tell them. You see, Master Luke they didn't believe me. Just as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. Thanks, Threepio. I...I never knew I had it in me.

Easy, Chewie. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie!

Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage. Han! Luke! Are you all right? Fine. Together again, huh? Wouldn't miss it. How are we doing? The same as always. That bad, huh? Where's Leia? I'm here. Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. Good, I hate long waits. You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. Doesn't sound so bad. In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years. On second thought, let's pass on that, huh? You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make. "
375,1471482451951,"Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.

Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!"
376,1462037263947,"Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. He will learn patience. Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father. Was I any different when you taught me? Hah. He is not ready. Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.

Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader... No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on. You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!"
377,1483056124598,"Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Luke! Where's Leia? What? She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!

Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry. Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. 

Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here."
378,1476138240028,"What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!

You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. well, this could be it, sweetheart. I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm not going to argue with that. Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. Closer? Closer?! h, this is suicide! There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah. That'll do nicely. Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? I hope you know what you're doing. Yeah, me too."
379,1475564889490,"Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir.

Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! Oh!! Luke! Luke! Grab him! What happened? I've got a very bad feeling about this. The walls are moving! Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something. Wait a minute! Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?

Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!

I can't see a thing in this helmet. This is not going to work. Why didn't you say so before? I did say so before! Where are you taking this...thing? Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight. I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. Look out! We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal. What happened? Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? We're sending a squad up. Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous.  Who is this? What's your operating number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!

You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. That's your uncle talking. Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?"
380,1478616157840,"Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. Okay, let's go. Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here! Is there anything I might do to help? Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.

There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready. What? You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. No! Commence primary ignition."
381,1479316598750,"Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie.

Luke! Luke, don't - it's a trap! It's a trap! The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet.

All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports. Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?  The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood? Right. Okay. Good luck. Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!

So was I, if you'll remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. Will he finished what he begins? I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. Oh, you will be. You will be."

The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed. We're starting our approach. Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived. Yes, sir.

Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.

Rise, my friend. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. Yes, my Master. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. As you wish. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. 

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by."
383,1462790538256,"Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one. Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.

Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know... Like we're being watched! Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here? I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm? Right. Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.  don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior. Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great."

Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!"
385,1483297106836,"Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! Get to the top! I can't Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. Hurry! One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it! I'm trying! Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We've had some problems... Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great."
386,1473676108546,"You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.  I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.

Oh. No one to meet us. I don't like this. Well, what would you like? Well, they did let us land. Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me. See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay? Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled. How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! Inever thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?

General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.  A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you. Thank you, General.

I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!"
387,1460130601796,"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers."
388,1466394432212,"How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.

Run, Luke! Run!

To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! Yes. We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.

Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! Sorry!

Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser. Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice? You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. Over my dead body. That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time. Yes, I'll bet you have. Sorry about the mess."
389,1456216648232,"What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?

Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good.  You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful."

No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great."
391,1466152387977,"Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie.

Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no."
392,1482905157336,"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.

Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.

This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs. I don't like the look of this. Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo? Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. What is it? Some kind of local trouble? Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements."
393,1486285754494,"I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures. Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead. The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally. Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough. I'm ready for anything. Come along, Artoo.

Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.

What is it? I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keeps repeating, She's here. Well, who...who has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She's here? Princess? What's going on? Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something. What are you talking about? The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've got to help her. Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?

Are they away? They have just made the jump into hyperspace. You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.

They've coming in! Three marks at two ten. I'll take them myself! Cover me! Yes, sir. I can't maneuver! Stay on target. We're too close. Stay on target! Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this is Red Leader."
394,1454980130461,"Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. It's metal. Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke. It could be a speeder, one of ours. No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code. It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out. Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.

If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish. What's going on...buddy? You're being put into carbon freeze. What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me. The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in! Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...! Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop! Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die. Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me? I love you! I know."
395,1466072943840,"Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by.

Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right? Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die. Move him into position. Put him in.

This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this. Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me. Yes, my Lord. The Emperor has been expecting you. I know, father. So, you have accepted the truth. I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. That name no longer has any meaning for me."
396,1471344624035,"Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three! It's not fair! The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault! No light-speed? It's not my fault. Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield. You're going to attack them?! Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer... Shut up!

No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian. Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain. You will not deviate from your present course. Rather touchy, aren't they? I thought you knew this person. Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that. Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven. Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me. Who's worried?"
397,1480885498909,"There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They're for sale if you want them. 

Hey...hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? Three-two-six-eight-two-seven. If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here. Well, let's get moving! Where are you going? No, wait. They'll hear! Come here, you big coward! Chewie! Come here! Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay? Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me! It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this.

What are you doing hiding there? It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning, kept babbling on about his mission. Oh, no! That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir.

They've coming in! Three marks at two ten. I'll take them myself! Cover me! Yes, sir. I can't maneuver! Stay on target. We're too close. Stay on target! Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this is Red Leader.

And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!"
398,1486194539913,"It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge.

Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late!

This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message. There will be no bargain. We're doomed. I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is. Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite. What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh! "
399,1472169221234,"Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!

Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. 

Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry. Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. 

Cut it out! I'm not gonna hurt you. Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. All right. You want something to eat? That's right. Come on. Hmmm? Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? What is it? Freeze! Come on, get up! Go get your ride and take her back to base. Yes, sir. Come on, let's get outta here."
400,1484441529549,"You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life. I happen to like nice men. I'm a nice man. No, you're not. You're... Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord."
401,1478780979952,"Good luck. You're gonna need it. General Madine. We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator. Sounds dangerous. I wonder who they found to pull that off. General Solo, is your strike team assembled? Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Rawwwrr! Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one. Uh, General... count me in. I'm with you, too! What is it? Ask me again sometime. Luke. Hi, Han... Chewie. Exciting is hardly the word I would use.

It's a trap!

Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!

I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.

Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!"
402,1481844353127,"Rendezvous at mark six point one. This is Red Two. Flying toward you. Red Three, standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them off for a few seconds.

We don't serve their kind here! What? Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. I heartily agree with you sir. Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn't like you. I'm sorry. I don't like you either You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems. I'll be careful than. You'll be dead. This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something...

The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. Not for long..."
403,1463970815726,"Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

Yes, Admiral? Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk... Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses. Yes, lord. I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems."
404,1477405828103,"You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.  I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way."
405,1457274628444,"This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message. There will be no bargain. We're doomed. I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is. Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite. What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh! "
406,1484868190243,"Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord.

The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone. And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-... Yes, sir? Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? Why not? Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.

Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!

Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no."
407,1465990984418,"The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. 

Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. 

Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!

Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message.

Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must."
408,1455198569940,"There's something not right here. I feel cold, death. That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go. What's in there? Only what you take with you. our weapons...you will not need them.

What is thy bidding, my master? There is a great disturbance in the Force. I have felt it. We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker. Yes, my master. He could destroy us. He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, my master."

What course shall we set?  Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure.

I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! I can't believe he's gone. There wasn't anything you could have done. Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet! You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!

All wings report in. Red Ten standing by. Red Seven standing by. Red Three standing by. Red Six standing by. Red Nine standing by. Red Two standing by. Red Eleven standing by. Red Five standing by.

I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him. Disintegrated? Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber. Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh! You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely. 

Rise, my friend. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. Yes, my Master. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. As you wish. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny."

I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no.

You all right? Why are you still here? I heard the command center had been hit. You got your clearance to leave. Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope. Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters. Imperial troops have entered the base. Come on...that's it. Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports! K-one-zero...all troops disengage.  Oh! Wait for me! Begin retreat! Fall back!

Yes, that's it. Dagobah. No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there... Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle... No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around."
412,1480423574038,"Artoo expresses his relief, also. How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark. Thanks to you. That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield. That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

Distance to power generators? One-seven, decimal two-eight. Target. Maximum fire power. Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon. But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!! Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical. Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident! Wait! Wait!"
413,1483983645427,"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.

What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? Hey, Luke...may the Force be with you! What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.

Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine."

But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Proper?! It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.

It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? Why not? Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.

What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser... He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord.

Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do. No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend, hmm? I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master. Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda. You know him? Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come. Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo."

Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to point... oh-five, we'll cover for you. Stay there... I just lost my starboard engine. Get set to make your attack run.

Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile. Sure, go ahead. What is it? Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire. How did my father die? A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. The Force?

Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!

Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station! The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.... The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line.

I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.

Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move. What do you think you're doing? We're getting out of here. I knew all along it had to be a mistake.

I'm just trying to help... We don't need any of your help. H-a-a-a... What? It sounds like Han. There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform... Chewie.

Don't get cocky. There are still two more of them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting!  This is all your fault.

You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready. What? You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. No! Commence primary ignition.

We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."

My scope's negative. I don't see anything. Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up. Biggs! You've picked one up...watch it! I can't see it! Where is he?! He's on me tight, I can't shake him...I can't shake him. Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in. Got him!

The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.

What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel."

But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan. Seventeen, huh! Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four. Ninety-four. Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork. All right, we'll check it out.

All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations. So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then? That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you. Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.

Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me! Pull in! Luke...pull in! Watch your back, Luke! Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in! I'm hit, but not bad. Artoo, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there. Red Six... Can you see Red Five? There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you? I can't shake him! I'm on him, Luke! Hold on! Blast it! Wedge where are you? Thanks, Wedge. Good shooting, Wedge!"
426,1473912304350,"We don't serve their kind here! What? Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. I heartily agree with you sir. Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn't like you. I'm sorry. I don't like you either You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems. I'll be careful than. You'll be dead. This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something..."
427,1455703604954,"Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now.

Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now."
428,1473666494666,"I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

So was I, if you'll remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. Will he finished what he begins? I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. Oh, you will be. You will be.

Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!

Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it. Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling."
429,1472330896436,"Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me. My...! Why, you stuck up...half-witted...scruffy-looking...nerf-herder! Who's scruffy-looking? I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid? Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet? Headquarters personnel, report to command center. Take it easy. Excuse us, please.

No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian. Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain. You will not deviate from your present course. Rather touchy, aren't they? I thought you knew this person. Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that. Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven. Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me. Who's worried?

Luke. Father. Son, come with me. Ben, why didn't you tell me? Chewie! It's Vader. Luke...it is your destiny. Ben, why didn't you tell me?

Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know... Like we're being watched! Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here? I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm? Right. Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.  don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior. Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great.

Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."
430,1477549934640,"Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here.

Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete."
431,1456277721152,"The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner."
432,1459948338528,"Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year. You mean the next semester before harvest? Sure, there're more than enough droids. Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke. But it's a whole 'nother year. Look, it's only one more season. Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. Where are you going? It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.

Are they away? They have just made the jump into hyperspace. You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.

How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way."
433,1468627315833,"The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. 

Move! Move! The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it!"
434,1482360956674,"You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

Run, Luke! Run!

Did you find any droids? No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked. Yes, sir. I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since... Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. 

It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins!

It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...I never heard of them hitting anything this big before. They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers. These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise. Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home! Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous. Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!"
435,1471053984947,"Good luck. You're gonna need it. General Madine. We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator. Sounds dangerous. I wonder who they found to pull that off. General Solo, is your strike team assembled? Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Rawwwrr! Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one. Uh, General... count me in. I'm with you, too! What is it? Ask me again sometime. Luke. Hi, Han... Chewie. Exciting is hardly the word I would use.

You cannot hide forever, Luke. I will not fight you. Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...

All wings report in. Red Leader standing by. Gray Leader standing by. Green Leader standing by. Lock S-foils in attack positions. May the Force be with us. We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no reading. Are you sure? Pull up! All craft pull up! Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

What is thy bidding, my Master? Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. Yes, my Master."
436,1465744811024,"Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!

The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You mean it controls your actions? Partially. But it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

Here they come! They're coming in too fast! Oooh! We've lost lateral controls. Don't worry, she'll hold together. You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don't get cocky. There are still two more of them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting!  This is all your fault."
437,1478416081949,"Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don't know what you're talking about. You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know? "
438,1458301652466,"The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

Move! Move! The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it!

You got her warmed? Yeah, she's comin' up. No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie. Hey, are you awake? Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again. Come on, General, let's move. Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody? All set. Here we go again. All right, hang on.

Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. "
439,1460510943709,"Luke? Lord Vader has set a trap for him. And we're the bait. Well, he's on his way. Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?  My friend! Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems. Yeah, you're a real hero. You certainly have a way with people.

Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back.

No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!

Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless! "
440,1464514636608,"They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you...always! Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil? Ben is a great man. Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. I didn't hear you give any ideas... Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up... Who do you think... 

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You mean it controls your actions? Partially. But it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.

How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station! The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.... The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.

All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations. So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then? That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight.

441,1467408768899,"Fighters coming in. There's too many of them! Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader.

Luke! Luke! Oh, Master Luke. I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia. I hope she's alright. What, Chewie? What? Chewie! Hey, I don't get it. Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie. Chewie, wa-wait! Don't! "
442,1486569396778,"Run, Luke! Run!

Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! Sorry!

Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there... No! wait! Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed! Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed. Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst... It's worst. There's something alive in here! That's your imagination. Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? What? Help!

I can't see a thing in this helmet. This is not going to work. Why didn't you say so before? I did say so before! Where are you taking this...thing? Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight. I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. Look out! We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal. What happened? Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? We're sending a squad up. Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous.  Who is this? What's your operating number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!"
443,1482170014972,"Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by.

This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this. Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me. Yes, my Lord. The Emperor has been expecting you. I know, father. So, you have accepted the truth. I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. That name no longer has any meaning for me.

Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck. You, too."

445,1457300949495,"This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all. There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables. Mynocks? Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo! Wait a minute... All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!

What did you have in mind for your next move? Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas? No. Where are we? The Anoat system. Anoat system. There's not much there. No. "
446,1469245479224,"Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. "
447,1455541373577,"Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile. Sure, go ahead. What is it? Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire. How did my father die? A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. The Force?

They've coming in! Three marks at two ten. I'll take them myself! Cover me! Yes, sir. I can't maneuver! Stay on target. We're too close. Stay on target! Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this is Red Leader.

Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!

Lock the door, Artoo. All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next door. I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. You watch your language!"

Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me! Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no. "
449,1479764023903,"The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy. Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. What's he saying? He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge."
450,1485953097021,"Oh, I told you it was dangerous here. Shall we try and go around? It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us. Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here. Quietly, there might be more of them out there. Hey... it's me. Go for help! Go! Great. Come on. Over there! Two more of them! I see them. Wait, Leia! Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch! Hey, wait! Ahhh! Move closer! Get alongside that one! Get him! Keep on that one! I'll take these two!

Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late!

Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. What's going on? I don't know. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. Thank you. Okay. He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day."
451,1483228536959,"Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.

Luke. Father. Son, come with me. Ben, why didn't you tell me? Chewie! It's Vader. Luke...it is your destiny. Ben, why didn't you tell me?

Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know... Like we're being watched! Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here? I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm? Right. Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.  don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior. Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great."

Right. ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations. As you wish. Lord Vader! My lord, we have them. 

...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed. No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found. Lord Vader. Yes, Admiral, what is it? The Emperor commands you make contact with him. Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission. Yes, my lord.

All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports. Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?  The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood? Right. Okay. Good luck. Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!"

If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil. Patience. And sacrifice Han and Leia? If you honor what they fight for...yes! If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters. Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side. Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse. That boy is our last hope. No. There is another.

Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don't know what you're talking about. You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know?

You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up. Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right. Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo. Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope. Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed. Close the doors. Yes, sir.

Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord."
455,1471627421192,"We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers! We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke, let me know when you're going in. I'm on my way in now... Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way.

He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand. It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.

Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. That's what I'm afraid of.

What is it? I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keeps repeating, She's here. Well, who...who has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She's here? Princess? What's going on? Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something. What are you talking about? The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've got to help her. Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?

Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic... Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan... You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her away!"
456,1481675228727,"Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando. Lando system? Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him. Thanks.

What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser... He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord.

Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless! "
457,1483382977558,"You have learned much, young one. You'll find I'm full of surprises. Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true. No! All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. Impressive...most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me.

Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack. Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary. ust hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable. Dack? Dack! Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing. Rouge Three. Copy, Rouge Leader Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass. oming around, Rouge Leader.

I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.

They're moving to attack position. Shields up! Track them. They may come around for another pass. Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. hey can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device. Well, there's no trace of them, sir. Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit. Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area. Yes, Captain Needa.

Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! Oh, you did it!"
458,1458858654603,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.

We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this... I'm sure. Ugh! Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny.

Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master. You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father. Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. His lightsaber. Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.

Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late!"
459,1460570528007,"Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."
460,1469900307935,"Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year. You mean the next semester before harvest? Sure, there're more than enough droids. Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke. But it's a whole 'nother year. Look, it's only one more season. Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. Where are you going? It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids."
461,1478830184845,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-... Yes, sir? Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? Why not? Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.

Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know... Like we're being watched! Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here? I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm? Right. Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.  don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior. Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great.

Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice. Vader. Is the dark side stronger? No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. But how am I to know the good side from the bad? You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. But tell me why I can't... No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.

Let go. Sshh! et go, please. Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else."
462,1455989064563,"You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up. Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all. There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables. Mynocks? Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo! Wait a minute... All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!

Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie.

Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. Stop that. Stop what? Stop that! My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of? Afraid? You're trembling. I'm not trembling.

Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time."
463,1465962706075,"It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge.

Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead.

Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star."
464,1486506054141,"Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!

Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance. Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that! But who's going to fly it, kid! You? You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen... We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan. Seventeen, huh! Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four. Ninety-four. Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork. All right, we'll check it out.

Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir.

Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!

A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in range. That's no moon! It's a space station. It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about this. Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! But there's gotta be something you can do! There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight! You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting."
465,1484457606282,"The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. 

Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

What is thy bidding, my Master? Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. Yes, my Master.

No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me.

All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. Charges! Come on, come on! Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. Freeze! You Rebel scum. "
466,1464963109977,"We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers! We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke, let me know when you're going in. I'm on my way in now... Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way."
467,1456966720450,"Chewie! Get behind me! Get behind me! Can't get out that way. Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. See-Threepio! See-Threepio! Yes sir?  We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that? I didn't copy! I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out, all other information on your level is restricted."

Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me! Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no. 

All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!"
469,1484004432446,"Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station! The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.... The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station."
470,1471149994326,"Yes, Admiral? Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk... Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses. Yes, lord. I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems."
471,1479320966940,"It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...I never heard of them hitting anything this big before. They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers. These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise. Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home! Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous. Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!"
472,1468399059511,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no.

Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield. Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector. Good. Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control....Fire! The first transport is away."
473,1480592516750,"Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile. Sure, go ahead. What is it? Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire. How did my father die? A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. The Force?

How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way."
474,1474699778973,"Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!

Rendezvous at mark six point one. This is Red Two. Flying toward you. Red Three, standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them off for a few seconds.

475,1477587087004,"Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry. Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. 

Good luck. You're gonna need it. General Madine. We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator. Sounds dangerous. I wonder who they found to pull that off. General Solo, is your strike team assembled? Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Rawwwrr! Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one. Uh, General... count me in. I'm with you, too! What is it? Ask me again sometime. Luke. Hi, Han... Chewie. Exciting is hardly the word I would use."
476,1482360936907,"Here they come! They're coming in too fast! Oooh! We've lost lateral controls. Don't worry, she'll hold together. You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don't get cocky. There are still two more of them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting!  This is all your fault.

Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification. These are not the droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your business. Move along. Move along. Move along.

He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. But he can...

He is here... Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Surely he must be dead by now. Don't underestimate the power of the Force. The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. Yes. Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty-three. The princess! Put all sections on alert!"
477,1486094104677,"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.

Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't... What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!

What is it? I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keeps repeating, She's here. Well, who...who has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She's here? Princess? What's going on? Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something. What are you talking about? The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've got to help her. Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?

There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They're for sale if you want them. 

That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!"
478,1469742296155,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish. What's going on...buddy? You're being put into carbon freeze. What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me. The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in! Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...! Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop! Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die. Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me? I love you! I know.

Distance to power generators? One-seven, decimal two-eight. Target. Maximum fire power. Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon. But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!! Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical. Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident! Wait! Wait!"

Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe?

The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! Oh!! Luke! Luke! Grab him! What happened? I've got a very bad feeling about this. The walls are moving! Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something. Wait a minute! Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?"
480,1462327615069,"I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful! Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow! Leia! Go! I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better.

Let go. Sshh! et go, please. Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.

The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to... No time to discuss this as a committee. I am not a committee! You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field... Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off! Look! I see it, I see it. We're doomed! The cave is collapsing. This is no cave. What?

The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me? I love you! I know."
481,1464803089692,"Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck. You, too.

It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge."
482,1468176197517,"The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. Leia! Leia's my sister. Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.

Look! Get him off of there! I think I got it. I got it! Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? Let's see. It's not bad. Freeze! Oh, dear. Don't move! I love you. I know. Hands up! Stand up! Stay back. Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea.

Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right? Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die. Move him into position. Put him in."

Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do. No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend, hmm? I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master. Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda. You know him? Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come. Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.

Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader... No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on. You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!

Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it. Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.

Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. He will learn patience. Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father. Was I any different when you taught me? Hah. He is not ready. Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready."
484,1464400625086,"Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!

Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! Oh!! Luke! Luke! Grab him! What happened? I've got a very bad feeling about this.

Run, Luke! Run!"

Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this is Red Leader.

Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there... No! wait! Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed! Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed. Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst... It's worst. There's something alive in here! That's your imagination. Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? What? Help!"
486,1456932905118,"...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed. No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found. Lord Vader. Yes, Admiral, what is it? The Emperor commands you make contact with him. Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission. Yes, my lord."
487,1469662472951,"Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station! The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.... The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.

What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always."
488,1464661232554,"Luke! Luke! Oh, Master Luke. I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia. I hope she's alright. What, Chewie? What? Chewie! Hey, I don't get it. Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie. Chewie, wa-wait! Don't! 

Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by.

All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!"
489,1482536844280,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no.

Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move. What do you think you're doing? We're getting out of here. I knew all along it had to be a mistake. Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you? I had no choice... What are you doing? Trust him, trust him! Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice. I'm just trying to help... We don't need any of your help. H-a-a-a... What? It sounds like Han. There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform... Chewie. I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.

But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not.  don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah! Oh, Artoo, let him have it. Mine! Mine! Artoo! Mine! Mine!"

Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. 

I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.

It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny."
491,1482561225204,"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.

Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic... Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan... You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her away!

What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always."
492,1465211803538,"What did you have in mind for your next move? Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas? No. Where are we? The Anoat system. Anoat system. There's not much there. No. 

There's something not right here. I feel cold, death. That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go. What's in there? Only what you take with you. our weapons...you will not need them.

Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

Yes, that's it. Dagobah. No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there... Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle... No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around.

Let go. Sshh! et go, please. Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else."
493,1486518489339,"He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message. What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! Luke? Luke! Come to dinner! All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.

Take over! See to him! Look there! They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. Follow me! You stand guard. Come on! Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. All right."
494,1475973750627,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-... Yes, sir? Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? Why not? Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.

Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh! You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett. Yes, my lord. Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader."
495,1467623194321,"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. "
496,1462781471861,"Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don't know what you're talking about. You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know? "
497,1479017373670,"Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando. Lando system? Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him. Thanks."
498,1483026875642,"Move! Move! The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it!

Rise, my friend. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. Yes, my Master. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. As you wish. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen."
499,1468996763835,"Easy, Chewie. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! Hold it! Whoa! Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!"
500,1476287601130,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish. What's going on...buddy? You're being put into carbon freeze. What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me. The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in! Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...! Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop! Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die. Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me? I love you! I know.

Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners! I don't know how we're going to get out of this one. Oww! Chewie! That was no laser blast! Something hit us. Han, get up here! Come on, Chewie! Asteroids! Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one. What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field? They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they? You don't have to do this to impress me. Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one. Never tell me the odds!"
501,1455457987002,"Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there... No! wait! Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed! Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed. Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst... It's worst. There's something alive in here! That's your imagination. Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? What? Help!

That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!"
502,1472033655900,"I told you to remain on the command ship. A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. Yes, I know. My son is with them. Are you sure? I have felt him, my Master. Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. They are clear, my Master. Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. He will come to me? I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you andthen you will bring him before me. As you wish.

Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage. Han! Luke! Are you all right? Fine. Together again, huh? Wouldn't miss it. How are we doing? The same as always. That bad, huh? Where's Leia? I'm here. Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. Good, I hate long waits. You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. Doesn't sound so bad. In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years. On second thought, let's pass on that, huh? You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make. 

Rise, my friend. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. Yes, my Master. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. As you wish.

503,1485339570521,"What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?

Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time.

Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch. Right, sir. Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off! Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-sevens. Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. Take care, sir. Thanks. Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right? Yeah. Be careful. You, too.Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.

I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful! Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow! Leia! Go! I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better.

I don't...I don't believe it. That is why you fail."
504,1469189448718,"Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! Sorry!"
505,1457383811216,"How's this? Would it helped if I got out and pushed? It might. Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait. he bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade. This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.  Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See? Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it. Punch it!

Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! Oh, you did it!

Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners! I don't know how we're going to get out of this one. Oww! Chewie! That was no laser blast!

506,1475842372177,"It's a trap!

What is thy bidding, my Master? Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. Yes, my Master.

Tee chuta hhat yudd! Goodness gracious me! Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt. I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me! Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no. 

Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message."
507,1468745430020,"Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. 

We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this... I'm sure. Ugh! Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!"
508,1455552902697,"Have you been in many battles? Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways. Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or... 

Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? Come on! 

Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. I see, sir. Uh, you can call me Luke. I see, sir Luke. Just Luke. And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo. Hello. You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action. With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all. You know of the Rebellion against the Empire? That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir."
509,1481063407819,"Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.

Luke...Luke. Ben? You will go to the Dagobah system. Dagobah system? There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me. Ben...Ben. Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. Not much time. Ben...Ben... Hang on, kid. Dagobah system... Whew... Dagobah... This may smell bad, kid... Yoda... but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built. Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!

You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.  I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.

Luke! Luke, don't - it's a trap! It's a trap! The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet."
510,1458400364438,"Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you. Obi-Wan has taught you well. I will not fight you, father. You are unwise to lower your defenses. Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. There is no conflict. You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. Good. Good.

Cut it out! I'm not gonna hurt you. Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. All right. You want something to eat? That's right. Come on. Hmmm? Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? What is it? Freeze! Come on, get up! Go get your ride and take her back to base. Yes, sir. Come on, let's get outta here."
511,1462704222782,"So was I, if you'll remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. Will he finished what he begins? I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. Oh, you will be. You will be.

Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie.

Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil. Patience. And sacrifice Han and Leia? If you honor what they fight for...yes! If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters. Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side. Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse. That boy is our last hope. No. There is another.

Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good.  You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful."
512,1466636175732,"Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move. What do you think you're doing? We're getting out of here. I knew all along it had to be a mistake. Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you? I had no choice... What are you doing? Trust him, trust him! Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice. I'm just trying to help... We don't need any of your help. H-a-a-a... What? It sounds like Han. There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform... Chewie. I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.

Distance to power generators? One-seven, decimal two-eight. Target. Maximum fire power. Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon. But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!! Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical. Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident! Wait! Wait!

You all right? Why are you still here? I heard the command center had been hit. You got your clearance to leave. Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope. Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters. Imperial troops have entered the base. Come on...that's it. Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports! K-one-zero...all troops disengage.  Oh! Wait for me! Begin retreat! Fall back!"

Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point-blank range. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. She's gonna blow! I'm hit!"

All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!"
517,1455968502475,"Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not? I am See-Threepio, human-cy... Yes or no will do. Oh. Well, yes. How many languages do you speak? I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him. Disintegrated? Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber. Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh! You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely. 

Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck. You, too.

No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me.

The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please."

If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision. Father, please. Help me. Now, young Skywalker...you will die."

We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this... I'm sure. Ugh! Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message."

Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me! Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no. 

That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time."
521,1486320313788,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-... Yes, sir? Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? Why not? Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.

Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no."
522,1483712386540,"Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack. Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary. ust hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable. Dack? Dack! Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing. Rouge Three. Copy, Rouge Leader Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass. oming around, Rouge Leader.

Afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct. An Imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation.

They're moving to attack position. Shields up! Track them. They may come around for another pass. Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. hey can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device. Well, there's no trace of them, sir. Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit. Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area. Yes, Captain Needa.

Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don't know what you're talking about. You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know? "
523,1474531588644,"Did you find any droids? No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked. Yes, sir. I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since... Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. 

General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.

We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers! We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke, let me know when you're going in. I'm on my way in now... Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way.

No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. You fought in the Clone Wars? Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father. I wish I'd known him. He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did."
524,1479028238039,"They've coming in! Three marks at two ten. I'll take them myself! Cover me! Yes, sir. I can't maneuver! Stay on target. We're too close. Stay on target! Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this is Red Leader.

Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! Get to the top! I can't Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. Hurry! One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it! I'm trying! Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We've had some problems... Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great.

That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?"
525,1456870890608,"Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.

No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!

What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?"

527,1463011374630,"What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always.

We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."
528,1471677059145,"Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.

Luke. Father. Son, come with me. Ben, why didn't you tell me? Chewie! It's Vader. Luke...it is your destiny. Ben, why didn't you tell me?

Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader... No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on. You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!

I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain."
529,1481200584632,"The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone. And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good.  You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.

Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch. Right, sir. Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off! Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-sevens. Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. Take care, sir. Thanks. Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right? Yeah. Be careful. You, too.Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault."
530,1474337741447,"If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision. Father, please. Help me. Now, young Skywalker...you will die.

The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy. Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. What's he saying? He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.

Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. 

Move! Move! The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it!"

Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck. You, too.

All wings report in. Red Leader standing by. Gray Leader standing by. Green Leader standing by. Lock S-foils in attack positions. May the Force be with us. We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no reading. Are you sure? Pull up! All craft pull up! Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Luke! Where's Leia? What? She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!"

It can wait. he bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade. This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.  Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See? Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it. Punch it!

Admiral. Yes, Captain I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had. We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads! The visuals indicate life readings. It could mean anything. If we followed every lead... But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms. You found something? Yes, my lord. That's it. The Rebels are there. My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be... hat is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men."

I'll cover for you. Coming around. Watch that cross fire, boys. Set for position three. Steady. Stay tight and low. Hobbie, I've been hit!

The security codes has been changed! Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way. Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.

No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!

But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not.  don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah! Oh, Artoo, let him have it. Mine! Mine! Artoo! Mine! Mine!"
534,1458441235611,"Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dack. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station Three-T-Eight. We have spotted Imperial walkers! Imperial walkers on the north ridge. Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.  All right, boys, keep tight now. Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now! All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armor's too strong for blasters."

It could be a speeder, one of ours. No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code. It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out. Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.

No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!

What did you have in mind for your next move? Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas? No. Where are we? The Anoat system. Anoat system. There's not much there. No. "
536,1486587379863,"Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner. But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters... You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it! All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go. Uncle Owen... Yeah?This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look! Hey, what're you trying to push on us? Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain. Uncle Owen... Yeah? What about that one? What about that blue one? We'll take that one. Yeah, take it away.

Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year. You mean the next semester before harvest? Sure, there're more than enough droids. Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke. But it's a whole 'nother year. Look, it's only one more season. Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. Where are you going? It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids."
537,1455911955482,"Red Leader... This is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run. I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. Stay in attack formation! The exhaust post is... marked and locked in! Switch power to front deflector screens. How many guns do you think, Gold Five. I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers. Death Star will be in range in five minutes. Switching to targeting computer. Computer's locked. Getting a signal. The guns...they've stopped! Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.

No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals.

Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't... What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!

Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there... No! wait! Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed! Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed. Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst... It's worst. There's something alive in here! That's your imagination. Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? What? Help!

Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts. What's going on? Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan! What do you mean? Where is it? Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed...by the Empire!"
538,1473106553715,"As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!

I told you to remain on the command ship. A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. Yes, I know. My son is with them. Are you sure? I have felt him, my Master. Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. They are clear, my Master. Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. He will come to me? I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you andthen you will bring him before me. As you wish.

Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. Artoo whistles timidly. Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit. Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose. There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke. 

I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. Yoda will always be with you. Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view! Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. "

All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. Charges! Come on, come on! Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. Freeze! You Rebel scum. 

Move! Move! The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it!"
540,1459246342727,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker."
541,1478486841491,"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!"
542,1470299010571,"Wake up! Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. I have no need for a protocol droid. Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators. You could say... Do you speak Bocce? Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me...I'm as fluent in... All right shut up! I'll take this one.

Red Leader... This is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run. I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. Stay in attack formation! The exhaust post is... marked and locked in! Switch power to front deflector screens. How many guns do you think, Gold Five. I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers. Death Star will be in range in five minutes. Switching to targeting computer. Computer's locked. Getting a signal. The guns...they've stopped! Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.

We don't serve their kind here! What? Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. I heartily agree with you sir. Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn't like you. I'm sorry. I don't like you either You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems. I'll be careful than. You'll be dead. This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something...

Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station! The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.... The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.

Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion."
543,1468627338411,"All wings report in. Red Ten standing by. Red Seven standing by. Red Three standing by. Red Six standing by. Red Nine standing by. Red Two standing by. Red Eleven standing by. Red Five standing by. Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through their magnetic field. Hold tight! Switch your deflectors on. Double front!

The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. Not for long..."

Did you find any droids? No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked. Yes, sir. I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since... Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. "
545,1483161360706,"Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck. You, too."
546,1477509593144,"Luke? Lord Vader has set a trap for him. And we're the bait. Well, he's on his way. Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?  My friend! Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems. Yeah, you're a real hero. You certainly have a way with people."
547,1473016074537,"Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. What's going on? I don't know. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. Thank you. Okay. He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.

It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny."
548,1466671163177,"General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.  A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you. Thank you, General.

Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate! Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. All right, I'll give it a try. No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try. I can't. It's too big. Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ..not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship! You want the impossible.

Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. Stop that. Stop what? Stop that! My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of? Afraid? You're trembling. I'm not trembling.

You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up. Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right. Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo. Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope. Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed. Close the doors. Yes, sir.

Echo Base...I've got something! Not much, but it could be a life form. This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two. Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by. Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found them. Repeat, I found them. Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again."
549,1467058399034,"Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. 

Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. What's going on? I don't know. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.

And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.

Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!

All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!"
550,1486198457972,"You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.

I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer."
551,1462702599809,"What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser... He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord.

Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you."
552,1475744783400,"What is thy bidding, my master? There is a great disturbance in the Force. I have felt it. We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker. Yes, my master. He could destroy us. He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, my master.

Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough... I feel terrible. Why are they doing this? They never even asked me any questions. Lando. Get out of here, Lando! Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. Over to you? They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. What about Han? Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.  Vader wants us all dead. He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.

Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!

Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. It's metal. Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke. It could be a speeder, one of ours. No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code. It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out. Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.

You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. well, this could be it, sweetheart. I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm not going to argue with that. Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. Closer? Closer?! h, this is suicide! There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah. That'll do nicely. Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? I hope you know what you're doing. Yeah, me too."
553,1479239038044,"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too? o, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive. Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive. Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...

Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners! I don't know how we're going to get out of this one. Oww! Chewie! That was no laser blast! Something hit us. Han, get up here! Come on, Chewie! Asteroids! Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one. What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field? They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they? You don't have to do this to impress me. Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one. Never tell me the odds!

Oh! Nice to see a familiar face. E chu ta! ow rude! That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if... Hello? How interesting. Oh, my. Who are you? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!

Distance to power generators? One-seven, decimal two-eight. Target. Maximum fire power. Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon. But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!! Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical. Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident! Wait! Wait!"

Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord."

All right, all right, you old smoothie.

...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed. No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found. Lord Vader. Yes, Admiral, what is it? The Emperor commands you make contact with him. Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission. Yes, my lord.

What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?"

I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. "
557,1459951293179,"Take over! See to him! Look there! They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. Follow me! You stand guard. Come on! Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. All right.

The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year. You mean the next semester before harvest? Sure, there're more than enough droids. Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke. But it's a whole 'nother year. Look, it's only one more season. Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. Where are you going? It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.

He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message. What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! Luke? Luke! Come to dinner! All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.

I'm not going anywhere. They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. But they're going to kill her! Better her than me... She's rich. Rich? Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... What? Well more wealth that you can imagine. I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! You'll get it! I better! You will..."
558,1472651652180,"Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.

All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports. Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?  The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood? Right. Okay. Good luck. Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!

You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.  I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.

What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows?

Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. I want fifty thousand. No less. Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator. This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. Zeebuss. He agrees! Just relax for a moment. 

Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. It is pointless to resist, my son. Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.

You got her warmed? Yeah, she's comin' up. No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie. Hey, are you awake? Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again. Come on, General, let's move. Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody? All set. Here we go again. All right, hang on.

Well, look at you, a general, huh? Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack. I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.

Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete."
562,1485523712159,"As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!"
563,1470720117063,"It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins!"
564,1470793489891,"Luke! Luke! Oh, Master Luke. I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia. I hope she's alright. What, Chewie? What? Chewie! Hey, I don't get it. Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie. Chewie, wa-wait! Don't! 

The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. I can't see. Your eyesight will return in time. Where am I? Jabba's palace. Who are you? Someone who loves you. Leia! I gotta get you out of here. What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault. It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder. Look... Take him away! Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool! Bring her to me.

Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you. Obi-Wan has taught you well. I will not fight you, father. You are unwise to lower your defenses. Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. There is no conflict. You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. Good. Good.

Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead."
565,1460592980168,"Rise, my friend. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. Yes, my Master. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. As you wish. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. Charges! Come on, come on! Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. Freeze! You Rebel scum. 

Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above! Red Three, Red Two, pull in! Got it! Three of them coming in, twenty degrees! Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate. Pressure's steady. Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for. We're in attack position now, sir. Hold here. We're not going to attack? I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.

Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here.

Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not? I am See-Threepio, human-cy... Yes or no will do. Oh. Well, yes. How many languages do you speak? I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him. Disintegrated? Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber. Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh! You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely. "
566,1471160075278,"This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs. I don't like the look of this. Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo? Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. What is it? Some kind of local trouble? Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.

What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always."
567,1458395365496,"You got her warmed? Yeah, she's comin' up. No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie. Hey, are you awake? Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again. Come on, General, let's move. Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody? All set. Here we go again. All right, hang on.

Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. 

The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. Leia! Leia's my sister. Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.

Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. 

We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you."
568,1470889878199,"Watch out. Squad at .06. I'm on it, Gold Leader. Good shot, Red Two. Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.

We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this... I'm sure. Ugh! Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. Artoo whistles timidly. Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit. Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose. There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke. 

Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck. You, too.

Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. "
569,1479455109198,"I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.

Where is that shuttle going? Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination? Parts and technical crew for the forest moon. Do they have a code clearance? It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. Shall I hold them? No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself. As you wish, my lord. Carry on. They're not goin' for it, Chewie. Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course. Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem."
570,1478558743993,"Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless! 

Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do. No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend, hmm? I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master. Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda. You know him? Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come. Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo."
571,1471617476072,"You all right? Why are you still here? I heard the command center had been hit. You got your clearance to leave. Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope. Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters. Imperial troops have entered the base. Come on...that's it. Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports! K-one-zero...all troops disengage.  Oh! Wait for me! Begin retreat! Fall back!

I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

Artoo? Artoo! Where are you?

Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners! I don't know how we're going to get out of this one. Oww! Chewie! That was no laser blast! Something hit us. Han, get up here! Come on, Chewie! Asteroids! Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one. What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field? They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they? You don't have to do this to impress me. Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one. Never tell me the odds!

What is thy bidding, my master? There is a great disturbance in the Force. I have felt it. We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker. Yes, my master. He could destroy us. He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, my master."
572,1467806861378,"Rendezvous at mark six point one. This is Red Two. Flying toward you. Red Three, standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them off for a few seconds.

Are they away? They have just made the jump into hyperspace. You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.

What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.

Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready. You'll have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser. Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice? You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. Over my dead body. That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time. Yes, I'll bet you have. Sorry about the mess."
573,1486111882997,"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

Wake up! Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. I have no need for a protocol droid. Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators. You could say... Do you speak Bocce? Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me...I'm as fluent in... All right shut up! I'll take this one.

It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...I never heard of them hitting anything this big before. They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers. These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise. Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home! Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous. Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!

What is it? I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keeps repeating, She's here. Well, who...who has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She's here? Princess? What's going on? Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something. What are you talking about? The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've got to help her. Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?

What are you doing hiding there? It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning, kept babbling on about his mission. Oh, no! That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir."
574,1483144206500,"So was I, if you'll remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. Will he finished what he begins? I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. Oh, you will be. You will be.

Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time.

Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!

Let go. Sshh! et go, please. Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else."
575,1458894598891,"Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in. Not likely. Are the speeders ready? Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold. Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns. Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly. That's right. And my friends out in it. I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha. Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker. Then I'll see you in hell!

Yes, that's it. Dagobah. No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there... Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle... No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around.

What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser... He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord."
576,1464617194575,"That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!"
577,1482204628291,"My scope's negative. I don't see anything. Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up. Biggs! You've picked one up...watch it! I can't see it! Where is he?! He's on me tight, I can't shake him...I can't shake him. Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in. Got him!"
578,1484352829147,"General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.  A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you. Thank you, General.

What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?

I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

Distance to power generators? One-seven, decimal two-eight. Target. Maximum fire power. Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon. But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!! Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical. Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident! Wait! Wait!"
579,1477167471722,"Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by.

This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this. Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me. Yes, my Lord. The Emperor has been expecting you. I know, father. So, you have accepted the truth. I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. That name no longer has any meaning for me.

If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision. Father, please. Help me. Now, young Skywalker...you will die.

Where is that shuttle going? Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination? Parts and technical crew for the forest moon. Do they have a code clearance? It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. Shall I hold them? No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself. As you wish, my lord. Carry on. They're not goin' for it, Chewie. Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course. Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem."
580,1457344365777,"I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say? I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. Leia! Oh! Your Royal Highness. But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free. Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly -- Just tell them. You see, Master Luke they didn't believe me. Just as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. Thanks, Threepio. I...I never knew I had it in me.

If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie. We have you on our screen now. Please identify. Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield. Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. Transmission commencing. Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. It'll work. It'll work. Vader's on that ship. Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know. Fly casual. I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here."
581,1459808488604,"Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't... What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!"
582,1462840833663,"They're moving to attack position. Shields up! Track them. They may come around for another pass. Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. hey can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device. Well, there's no trace of them, sir. Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit. Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area. Yes, Captain Needa.

Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you."
583,1476824609180,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-... Yes, sir? Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? Why not? Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger."
584,1465602786693,"Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts. What's going on? Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan! What do you mean? Where is it? Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed...by the Empire!

They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you...always! Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil? Ben is a great man. Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. I didn't hear you give any ideas... Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up... Who do you think... "
585,1464664764864,"Luke. Father. Son, come with me. Ben, why didn't you tell me? Chewie! It's Vader. Luke...it is your destiny. Ben, why didn't you tell me?

Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield. Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector. Good. Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control....Fire! The first transport is away.

Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. It's metal. Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke. It could be a speeder, one of ours. No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code. It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out. Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight."
586,1484933324585,"Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him?

What are you doing hiding there? It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning, kept babbling on about his mission. Oh, no! That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir.

Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion."
587,1480371562166,"Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. That's what I'm afraid of."
588,1455032326832,"All wings report in. Red Leader standing by. Gray Leader standing by. Green Leader standing by. Lock S-foils in attack positions. May the Force be with us. We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no reading. Are you sure? Pull up! All craft pull up! Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. Artoo whistles timidly. Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit. Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose. There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke. "
589,1483835990368,"The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone. And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

I don't...I don't believe it. That is why you fail.

The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to... No time to discuss this as a committee. I am not a committee! You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field... Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off! Look! I see it, I see it. We're doomed! The cave is collapsing. This is no cave. What?"
590,1480992401553,"Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message.

Well, look at you, a general, huh? Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack. I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come."
591,1461040502760,"Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.

What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always."
592,1472378279006,"Rendezvous at mark six point one. This is Red Two. Flying toward you. Red Three, standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them off for a few seconds.

A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in range. That's no moon! It's a space station. It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about this. Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! But there's gotta be something you can do! There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight! You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.

The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner."
593,1458190935336,"We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers! We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke, let me know when you're going in. I'm on my way in now... Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way.

General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.

Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now."
594,1482101948844,"Run, Luke! Run!

They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you...always! Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil? Ben is a great man. Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. I didn't hear you give any ideas... Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up... Who do you think... 

Red Leader... This is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run. I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. Stay in attack formation! The exhaust post is... marked and locked in! Switch power to front deflector screens. How many guns do you think, Gold Five. I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers. Death Star will be in range in five minutes. Switching to targeting computer. Computer's locked. Getting a signal. The guns...they've stopped! Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters."
595,1486272971740,"Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? Come on! 

There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They're for sale if you want them. 

And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!

Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now.

Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. Okay, let's go. Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here! Is there anything I might do to help? Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on."
596,1477106927756,"You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life. I happen to like nice men. I'm a nice man. No, you're not. You're... Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too? o, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive. Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive. Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most..."
597,1460879583022,"Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.

Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. 

You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack"
598,1484648989970,"Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck!

I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend."
599,1464611762388,"I can't see a thing in this helmet. This is not going to work. Why didn't you say so before? I did say so before! Where are you taking this...thing? Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight. I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. Look out! We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal. What happened? Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? We're sending a squad up. Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous.  Who is this? What's your operating number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!"
600,1460244329994,"He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. But he can...

I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! I can't believe he's gone. There wasn't anything you could have done. Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet! You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!"
601,1470137126440,"Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it. Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.

You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. well, this could be it, sweetheart. I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm not going to argue with that. Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. Closer? Closer?! h, this is suicide! There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah. That'll do nicely. Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? I hope you know what you're doing. Yeah, me too.

Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. It's metal. Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.

Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don't know what you're talking about. You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know? "
602,1482946710310,"I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. Yoda will always be with you. Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view! Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. 

I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. Oh... great! Soon you will learn to appreciate me. Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! Hmm. I wish I had your confidence. Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas."
603,1477233643044,"Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear."

So was I, if you'll remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. Will he finished what he begins? I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. Oh, you will be. You will be.

Yes, Admiral? Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk... Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses. Yes, lord. I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems."
605,1458035392711,"He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message. What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! Luke? Luke! Come to dinner! All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.

Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station! The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.... The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.

Where could they be? Close the blast doors! Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner, now I am the master. Only a master of evil, Darth. Your powers are weak, old man. You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone."
606,1462579665625,"Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it. Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.

You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up. Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right. Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo. Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope. Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed. Close the doors. Yes, sir.

Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in. Not likely. Are the speeders ready? Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold. Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns. Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly. That's right. And my friends out in it. I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha. Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker. Then I'll see you in hell!

Artoo expresses his relief, also. How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark. Thanks to you. That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield. That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight."
607,1463133849289,"Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must.

As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!

Tee chuta hhat yudd! Goodness gracious me! Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt. I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me! Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no. "
608,1470458200714,"Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master. You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father. Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. His lightsaber. Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me."
609,1462685112721,"What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.

Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready. You'll have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

Have you been in many battles? Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways. Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or... 

Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic... Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan... You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her away!

Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!"
610,1471090440075,"A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in range. That's no moon! It's a space station. It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about this. Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! But there's gotta be something you can do! There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight! You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.

You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. That's your uncle talking. Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?

What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always.

What is it? I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keeps repeating, She's here. Well, who...who has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She's here? Princess? What's going on? Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something. What are you talking about? The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've got to help her. Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?"
611,1466151175479,"What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? Hey, Luke...may the Force be with you! What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.

Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! Oh!! Luke! Luke! Grab him! What happened? I've got a very bad feeling about this. The walls are moving! Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something. Wait a minute! Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.

I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! I can't believe he's gone. There wasn't anything you could have done. Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet! You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!

What's wrong? Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo? Okay, easy she goes! Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you."
612,1482954649900,"Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move. What do you think you're doing? We're getting out of here. I knew all along it had to be a mistake. Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you? I had no choice... What are you doing? Trust him, trust him! Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice. I'm just trying to help... We don't need any of your help. H-a-a-a... What? It sounds like Han. There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform... Chewie. I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.

This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all. There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables. Mynocks? Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo! Wait a minute... All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!

The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to... No time to discuss this as a committee. I am not a committee! You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field... Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off! Look! I see it, I see it. We're doomed! The cave is collapsing. This is no cave. What?

Yes, Admiral? Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk... Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses. Yes, lord. I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems."
613,1459084657160,"Afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct. An Imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation.

Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time.

Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you.

Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie."
614,1472158367589,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. What's this? What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that? Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Who is she? She's beautiful. I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi... I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to... Is there more to this recording? Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.

My scope's negative. I don't see anything. Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up. Biggs! You've picked one up...watch it! I can't see it! Where is he?! He's on me tight, I can't shake him...I can't shake him. Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in. Got him!

Look at the size of that thing! Cut the chatter, Red Two. Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys! Red Leader, this is Gold Leader. I copy, Gold Leader. We're starting for the target shaft now. We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire. Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees. I see it. Stay low. This is Red Five, I'm going in! Luke, pull up! Are you all right? I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.

Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!

Rendezvous at mark six point one. This is Red Two. Flying toward you. Red Three, standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them off for a few seconds."
615,1458946911680,"All wings report in. Red Leader standing by. Gray Leader standing by. Green Leader standing by. Lock S-foils in attack positions. May the Force be with us. We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no reading. Are you sure? Pull up! All craft pull up! Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47."
616,1480156527025,"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough... I feel terrible. Why are they doing this? They never even asked me any questions. Lando. Get out of here, Lando! Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. Over to you? They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. What about Han? Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.  Vader wants us all dead. He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.

Let go. Sshh! et go, please. Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.

They're moving to attack position. Shields up! Track them. They may come around for another pass. Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. hey can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device. Well, there's no trace of them, sir. Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit. Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area. Yes, Captain Needa.

What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?

Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless! "
617,1482095716300,"Run, Luke! Run!

Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me! Pull in! Luke...pull in! Watch your back, Luke! Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in! I'm hit, but not bad. Artoo, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there. Red Six... Can you see Red Five? There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you? I can't shake him! I'm on him, Luke! Hold on! Blast it! Wedge where are you? Thanks, Wedge. Good shooting, Wedge!"
618,1459247466094,"How's this? Would it helped if I got out and pushed? It might. Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait. he bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade. This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.  Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See? Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it. Punch it!

Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader... No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on. You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!

Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know... Like we're being watched! Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here? I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm? Right. Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.  don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior. Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great.

I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!"
619,1480135843399,"The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. That's impossible, even for a computer. It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters. Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!"
620,1486175230638,"This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message. There will be no bargain. We're doomed. I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is. Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite. What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh! 

We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this... I'm sure. Ugh! Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!

Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Proper?! It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.

The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please."
621,1461903673748,"Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. It is pointless to resist, my son. Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.

We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you.

Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead."
622,1468570987063,"Cut it out! I'm not gonna hurt you. Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. All right. You want something to eat? That's right. Come on. Hmmm? Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? What is it? Freeze! Come on, get up! Go get your ride and take her back to base. Yes, sir. Come on, let's get outta here.

Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Luke! Where's Leia? What? She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!

Luke! Luke! Oh, Master Luke. I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia. I hope she's alright. What, Chewie? What? Chewie! Hey, I don't get it. Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie. Chewie, wa-wait! Don't! 

No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me.

I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. Oh... great! Soon you will learn to appreciate me. Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! Hmm. I wish I had your confidence. Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas."
623,1463974748923,"This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this. Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me. Yes, my Lord. The Emperor has been expecting you. I know, father. So, you have accepted the truth. I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. That name no longer has any meaning for me."
624,1460690091537,"Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!

Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. 

Good luck. You're gonna need it. General Madine. We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator. Sounds dangerous. I wonder who they found to pull that off. General Solo, is your strike team assembled? Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Rawwwrr! Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one. Uh, General... count me in. I'm with you, too! What is it? Ask me again sometime. Luke. Hi, Han... Chewie. Exciting is hardly the word I would use."
625,1461010057688,"Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile. Sure, go ahead. What is it? Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire. How did my father die? A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. The Force?

Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her. The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?  Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure.

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.

Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't... What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!

Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser. Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice? You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. Over my dead body. That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time. Yes, I'll bet you have. Sorry about the mess."
626,1480565560609,"Well, look at you, a general, huh? Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack. I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come."
627,1457894268965,"I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. Yoda will always be with you. Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view! Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. 

Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker."
628,1485099201070,"Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. 

You cannot hide forever, Luke. I will not fight you. Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for..."
629,1460048342487,"Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield. Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector. Good. Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control....Fire! The first transport is away.

Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back. Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?

Oh! Nice to see a familiar face. E chu ta! ow rude! That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if... Hello? How interesting. Oh, my. Who are you? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!

Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been? Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me! Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!"
630,1462431414000,"Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack. Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary. ust hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable. Dack? Dack! Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing. Rouge Three. Copy, Rouge Leader Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass. oming around, Rouge Leader.

What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?

This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor. Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class. Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land. Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him. I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on Captain Solo."
631,1478842044695,"They've coming in! Three marks at two ten. I'll take them myself! Cover me! Yes, sir. I can't maneuver! Stay on target. We're too close. Stay on target! Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this is Red Leader.

Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts. What's going on? Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan! What do you mean? Where is it? Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed...by the Empire!"
632,1478242309975,"To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! Yes. We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.

Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't... What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!"
633,1459327102213,"But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not.  don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah! Oh, Artoo, let him have it. Mine! Mine! Artoo! Mine! Mine!

All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator. Rouge Two, are you all right? Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader. We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you. Coming around. Watch that cross fire, boys. Set for position three. Steady. Stay tight and low. Hobbie, I've been hit!

Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

Afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct. An Imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation.

If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish. What's going on...buddy? You're being put into carbon freeze. What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me. The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in! Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...! Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop! Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die. Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me? I love you! I know."
634,1483269952353,"Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort... I find your lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this! Vader, release him! As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.

It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins!

Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! Oh!! Luke! Luke! Grab him! What happened? I've got a very bad feeling about this. The walls are moving! Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something. Wait a minute! Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?

Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. Easy...you call that easy? Their tracking us! Not this ship, sister. At least the information in Artoo is still intact. What's so important? What's he carrying? The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet! It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money! You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!

My scope's negative. I don't see anything. Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up. Biggs! You've picked one up...watch it! I can't see it! Where is he?! He's on me tight, I can't shake him...I can't shake him. Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in. Got him!"
635,1475663469626,"What did you have in mind for your next move? Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas? No. Where are we? The Anoat system. Anoat system. There's not much there. No. 

Artoo? Artoo! Where are you?

Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now. Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm? How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there? Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm? Mostly because of my father, I guess. Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm. 

Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie.

Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it. Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling."
636,1473098029923,"Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate! Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. All right, I'll give it a try. No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try. I can't. It's too big. Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ..not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship! You want the impossible.

What did you have in mind for your next move? Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas? No. Where are we? The Anoat system. Anoat system. There's not much there. No. 

Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. He will learn patience. Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father. Was I any different when you taught me? Hah. He is not ready. Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.

Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners! I don't know how we're going to get out of this one. Oww! Chewie! That was no laser blast! Something hit us. Han, get up here! Come on, Chewie! Asteroids! Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one. What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field? They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they? You don't have to do this to impress me. Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one. Never tell me the odds!"
637,1473794758001,"Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here.

Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.

Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message."
638,1470059899280,"We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.

Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic... Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan... You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her away!

Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.

What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel."
639,1482478671440,"You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

My scope's negative. I don't see anything. Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up. Biggs! You've picked one up...watch it! I can't see it! Where is he?! He's on me tight, I can't shake him...I can't shake him. Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in. Got him!

Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move.

Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir."
640,1464695793694,"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.

How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.

No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. You fought in the Clone Wars? Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father. I wish I'd known him. He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.

They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you...always! Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil? Ben is a great man. Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. I didn't hear you give any ideas... Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up... Who do you think... "
641,1481591760429,"He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand. It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.

Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile. Sure, go ahead. What is it? Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire. How did my father die? A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. The Force?"
642,1455723978169,"We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you.

Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must.

You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!

Rise, my friend. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. Yes, my Master. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. As you wish. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen."
643,1458039963040,"Let go. Sshh! et go, please. Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else."
644,1474149400483,"Look at the size of that thing! Cut the chatter, Red Two. Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys! Red Leader, this is Gold Leader. I copy, Gold Leader. We're starting for the target shaft now. We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire. Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees. I see it. Stay low. This is Red Five, I'm going in! Luke, pull up! Are you all right? I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.

What are you doing hiding there? It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning, kept babbling on about his mission. Oh, no! That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir.

My scope's negative. I don't see anything. Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up. Biggs! You've picked one up...watch it! I can't see it! Where is he?! He's on me tight, I can't shake him...I can't shake him. Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in. Got him!

We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers! We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke, let me know when you're going in. I'm on my way in now... Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way."
645,1469818379203,"Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.

Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!"
646,1459255150723,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no.

Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you.

Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!"
647,1478610003685,"Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one. Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.

The security codes has been changed! Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way. Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump."
648,1474077815137,"The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. It is pointless to resist, my son. Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.

Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!

You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. I can't see. Your eyesight will return in time. Where am I? Jabba's palace. Who are you? Someone who loves you. Leia! I gotta get you out of here. What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault. It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder. Look... Take him away! Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool! Bring her to me.

Rise, my friend. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. Yes, my Master. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. As you wish. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen."
649,1468598628667,"This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all. There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables. Mynocks? Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo! Wait a minute... All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!

Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch. Right, sir. Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off! Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-sevens. Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. Take care, sir. Thanks. Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right? Yeah. Be careful. You, too.Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault."

What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

Easy, Chewie. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! Hold it! Whoa! Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!

I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.

Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!

Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead."
651,1470924440195,"What is thy bidding, my master? There is a great disturbance in the Force. I have felt it. We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker. Yes, my master. He could destroy us. He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, my master.

Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack. Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary. ust hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable. Dack? Dack! Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing. Rouge Three. Copy, Rouge Leader Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass. oming around, Rouge Leader.

Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield. Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector. Good. Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control....Fire! The first transport is away.

Oh! Nice to see a familiar face. E chu ta! ow rude! That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if... Hello? How interesting. Oh, my. Who are you? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!"
652,1455200555694,"Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser. Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice? You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. Over my dead body. That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time. Yes, I'll bet you have. Sorry about the mess.

No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. You fought in the Clone Wars? Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father. I wish I'd known him. He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did."
653,1473725877010,"Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in. Not likely. Are the speeders ready? Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold. Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns. Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly. That's right. And my friends out in it. I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha. Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker. Then I'll see you in hell!

Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless! 

Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know. Oh, switch off. Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these. Excuse me, sir.

Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay? Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me! It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this.

We don't serve their kind here! What? Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. I heartily agree with you sir. Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn't like you. I'm sorry. I don't like you either You just watch yourself. We're wanted men.

That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports. Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another drill. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it."

Let go. Sshh! et go, please. Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.

Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.

You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. well, this could be it, sweetheart. I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm not going to argue with that. Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. Closer? Closer?! h, this is suicide! There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah. That'll do nicely. Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? I hope you know what you're doing. Yeah, me too.

Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been? Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me! Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!"

If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters. Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side. Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse. That boy is our last hope. No. There is another.

The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. That's impossible, even for a computer. It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters. Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!"

Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! Hmm. I wish I had your confidence.

Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master. You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father. Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. His lightsaber. Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.

Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must.

Princess? What's going on? Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something. What are you talking about? The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've got to help her. Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here.

Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down? That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever. We would be honored if you would join us. I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too.

Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three! It's not fair! The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault! No light-speed? It's not my fault. Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield. You're going to attack them?! Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer... Shut up!

Admiral. Yes, Captain I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had. We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads! The visuals indicate life readings. It could mean anything. If we followed every lead... But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms. You found something? Yes, my lord. That's it. The Rebels are there. My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be... hat is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men."

General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.

These are not the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your business. Move along. Move along. Move along.

Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir."
664,1463031852250,"Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back.

Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dack. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station Three-T-Eight. We have spotted Imperial walkers! Imperial walkers on the north ridge. Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.  All right, boys, keep tight now. Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now! All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armor's too strong for blasters.

Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do. No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend, hmm? I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master. Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda. You know him? Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come. Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo."

Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off! Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-sevens. Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. Take care, sir. Thanks. Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right? Yeah. Be careful. You, too.Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault."
666,1467137199512,"Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. It's metal. Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke. It could be a speeder, one of ours. No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code. It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out. Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.

Admiral. Yes, Captain I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had. We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads! The visuals indicate life readings. It could mean anything. If we followed every lead... But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms. You found something? Yes, my lord. That's it. The Rebels are there. My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be... hat is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men."
667,1461305348756,"But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not.  don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah! Oh, Artoo, let him have it. Mine! Mine! Artoo! Mine! Mine!

All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator. Rouge Two, are you all right? Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader. We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you. Coming around. Watch that cross fire, boys. Set for position three. Steady. Stay tight and low. Hobbie, I've been hit!"

Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you.

Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too? o, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive. Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive. Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...

How's this? Would it helped if I got out and pushed? It might. Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait. he bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade. This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.  Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See? Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it. Punch it!

Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-... Yes, sir? Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? Why not? Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger."

Come on, give me a sign here. Not much time. Ben...Ben... Hang on, kid. Dagobah system... Whew... Dagobah... This may smell bad, kid... Yoda... but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built. Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!

This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor. Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class. Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land. Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him. I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on Captain Solo.

Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield. Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector. Good. Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control....Fire! The first transport is away."
671,1471444717937,"Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic... Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan... You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her away!

You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet."
672,1483682080785,"Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone. Han! Leia!  Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control. I saw...I saw a city in the clouds. Mmm. Friends you have there. They were in pain. It is the future you see. Future? Will they die? Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future. I've got to go to them. Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.

Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando?

673,1459156145027,"The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. 

I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say? I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. Leia! Oh! Your Royal Highness. But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free. Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly -- Just tell them. You see, Master Luke they didn't believe me. Just as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. Thanks, Threepio. I...I never knew I had it in me.

Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. "
674,1484577543370,"Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!

Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead.

Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here."

When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.

I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. Oh... great! Soon you will learn to appreciate me. Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! Hmm. I wish I had your confidence. Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas."

Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.

Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!

What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows?

Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay? Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me! It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this.

Chewie! Get behind me! Get behind me! Can't get out that way. Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. See-Threepio! See-Threepio! Yes sir?  We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that? I didn't copy! I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out, all other information on your level is restricted.

Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe?

The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner."

You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. Good. Good.

Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.

Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi... I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to... Is there more to this recording? Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort... I find your lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this! Vader, release him! As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke."

Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point-blank range. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. She's gonna blow! I'm hit!"

You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view! Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. 

We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this... I'm sure. Ugh! Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend."

Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?

Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do. No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend, hmm? I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master. Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda. You know him? Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come. Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.

Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now. Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm? How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there? Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm? Mostly because of my father, I guess. Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm. "

The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports. Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?  The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood? Right. Okay. Good luck. Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!

Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. Stop that. Stop what? Stop that! My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of? Afraid? You're trembling. I'm not trembling.

The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to... No time to discuss this as a committee. I am not a committee! You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field... Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off! Look! I see it, I see it. We're doomed! The cave is collapsing. This is no cave. What?

Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader... No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on. You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!"
687,1479536039306,"There she is. See-Threepio, do you copy? For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship. We're right above you. Stand by. You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought. Nice! Come on! It's them! Blast them! Get back to the ship! Where are you going? Come back! He certainly has courage. What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! I think we took a wrong turn. There's no lock! That oughta hold it for a while. Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge. Oh, I think I just blasted it. They're coming through! Here, hold this. Here they come! For luck!

Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! Oh!! Luke! Luke! Grab him! What happened? I've got a very bad feeling about this. The walls are moving! Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something. Wait a minute! Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?"
688,1475600090538,"All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!

Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late!

Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi."
689,1481340420654,"What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is. Well, Calrissian, did he survive? Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation. He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker. Skywalker has just landed, my lord. Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship. You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision. I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.

Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil. Patience. And sacrifice Han and Leia? If you honor what they fight for...yes! If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters. Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side. Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse. That boy is our last hope. No. There is another."
690,1471556312795,"Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here.

Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. What's going on? I don't know. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. Thank you. Okay. He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.

That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time."
691,1467871561074,"Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!

Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not? I am See-Threepio, human-cy... Yes or no will do. Oh. Well, yes. How many languages do you speak? I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him. Disintegrated? Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber. Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh! You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely. "
692,1482528707789,"Echo Base...I've got something! Not much, but it could be a life form. This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two. Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by. Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found them. Repeat, I found them. Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again.

Let go. Sshh! et go, please. Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.

Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know. Oh, switch off. Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these. Excuse me, sir. Put them back together right now. Might I have a word with you, please?

But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not.  don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah! Oh, Artoo, let him have it. Mine! Mine! Artoo! Mine! Mine!

You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life. I happen to like nice men. I'm a nice man. No, you're not. You're... Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir."
693,1480407848213,"You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.  I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.

What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!

The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to... No time to discuss this as a committee. I am not a committee! You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field... Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off! Look! I see it, I see it. We're doomed! The cave is collapsing. This is no cave. What?

The security codes has been changed! Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way. Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.

Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone. Han! Leia!  Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control. I saw...I saw a city in the clouds. Mmm. Friends you have there. They were in pain. It is the future you see. Future? Will they die? Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future. I've got to go to them. Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered."
694,1483403616765,"Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. What's going on? I don't know. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. Thank you. Okay. He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.

Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master. You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father. Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. His lightsaber. Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me."
695,1478565709068,"Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!

I'm not going anywhere. They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. But they're going to kill her! Better her than me... She's rich. Rich? Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... What? Well more wealth that you can imagine. I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! You'll get it! I better! You will...

This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs. I don't like the look of this. Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo? Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. What is it? Some kind of local trouble? Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.

All wings report in. Red Ten standing by. Red Seven standing by. Red Three standing by. Red Six standing by. Red Nine standing by. Red Two standing by. Red Eleven standing by. Red Five standing by. Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through their magnetic field. Hold tight! Switch your deflectors on. Double front!

To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! Yes. We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned."
696,1467683362636,"Wake up! Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. I have no need for a protocol droid. Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators. You could say... Do you speak Bocce? Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me...I'm as fluent in... All right shut up! I'll take this one.

It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins!

Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.

Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?

Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports. Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another drill. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it."
697,1461161415819,"Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate! Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. All right, I'll give it a try. No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try. I can't. It's too big. Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ..not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship! You want the impossible.

Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too? o, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive. Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive. Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...

Let go. Sshh! et go, please. Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else."

You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. 

We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you.

Look! Get him off of there! I think I got it. I got it! Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? Let's see. It's not bad. Freeze! Oh, dear. Don't move! I love you. I know. Hands up! Stand up! Stay back. Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea.

This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this. Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me. Yes, my Lord. The Emperor has been expecting you. I know, father. So, you have accepted the truth. I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. That name no longer has any meaning for me."
699,1464477044864,"Artoo! You be more careful. Artoo - that way! Artoo! Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken? If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy.

I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

The security codes has been changed! Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city.

700,1462542526138,"How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.

I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! I can't believe he's gone. There wasn't anything you could have done. Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet! You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!"
701,1473947555589,"How's this? Would it helped if I got out and pushed? It might. Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait. he bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade. This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.  Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See? Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it. Punch it!

Yes, that's it. Dagobah. No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there... Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle... No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around.

What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is.

Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts. What's going on? Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan! What do you mean? Where is it? Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed...by the Empire!

You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. That's your uncle talking. Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?

The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! Luke? Luke! Come to dinner! All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.

How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.

He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.

Look at the size of that thing! Cut the chatter, Red Two. Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys! Red Leader, this is Gold Leader. I copy, Gold Leader. We're starting for the target shaft now. We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire. Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees. I see it. Stay low. This is Red Five, I'm going in! Luke, pull up! Are you all right? I got a little cooked, but I'm okay."
704,1478418716695,"You cannot hide forever, Luke. I will not fight you. Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...

Fighters coming in. There's too many of them! Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader."
705,1485425600137,"What did you have in mind for your next move? Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas? No. Where are we? The Anoat system. Anoat system. There's not much there. No. 

This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all. There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables. Mynocks? Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo! Wait a minute... All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!

Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it. Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling."
706,1471782436632,"Wake up! Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. I have no need for a protocol droid. Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators. You could say... Do you speak Bocce? Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me...I'm as fluent in... All right shut up! I'll take this one.

Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.

Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. I see, sir. Uh, you can call me Luke. I see, sir Luke. Just Luke. And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo. Hello. You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action. With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all. You know of the Rebellion against the Empire? That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.

All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations. So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then? That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you. Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them."

Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Yeah, sure. Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!! Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else. Hey! Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow. Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness! Do you understand anything they're saying? Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. What are you telling them? Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

Cut it out! I'm not gonna hurt you. Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. All right. You want something to eat? That's right. Come on. Hmmm? Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? What is it? Freeze! Come on, get up! Go get your ride and take her back to base. Yes, sir. Come on, let's get outta here."
708,1456596264200,"The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to... No time to discuss this as a committee. I am not a committee! You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field... Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off! Look! I see it, I see it. We're doomed! The cave is collapsing. This is no cave. What?"
709,1474258274666,"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.

I'm not going anywhere. They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. But they're going to kill her! Better her than me... She's rich. Rich? Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... What? Well more wealth that you can imagine. I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! You'll get it! I better! You will...

General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.

You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers."
710,1485375622405,"The security codes has been changed! Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way. Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.

Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum. Those Rebels won't escape us. Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger. Right. ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations. As you wish. Lord Vader! My lord, we have them. 

Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in. Not likely. Are the speeders ready? Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold. Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns. Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly. That's right. And my friends out in it. I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha. Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker. Then I'll see you in hell!

Oh! Nice to see a familiar face. E chu ta! ow rude! That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if... Hello? How interesting. Oh, my. Who are you? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!

The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to... No time to discuss this as a committee. I am not a committee! You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field... Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off! Look! I see it, I see it. We're doomed! The cave is collapsing. This is no cave. What?"
711,1484861880169,"I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful! Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow! Leia! Go! I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better.

I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.

Yes, Admiral? Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk... Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses. Yes, lord. I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems."
712,1470375867278,"As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!

That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy. Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. What's he saying? He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge."
713,1464712469743,"No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian. Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain. You will not deviate from your present course. Rather touchy, aren't they? I thought you knew this person. Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that. Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven. Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me. Who's worried?

Afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct. An Imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation.

If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish. What's going on...buddy? You're being put into carbon freeze. What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me. The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in! Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...! Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop! Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die. Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me? I love you! I know.

Luke? Lord Vader has set a trap for him. And we're the bait. Well, he's on his way. Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?  My friend! Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems. Yeah, you're a real hero. You certainly have a way with people."
714,1482865838153,"Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. Oh... great! Soon you will learn to appreciate me. Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! Hmm. I wish I had your confidence. Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas."
715,1483766569746,"Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above! Red Three, Red Two, pull in! Got it! Three of them coming in, twenty degrees! Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate. Pressure's steady. Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for. We're in attack position now, sir. Hold here. We're not going to attack? I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping."
716,1473700083718,"Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi.

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by.

Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!

Well, look at you, a general, huh? Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack. I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.

Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. "
717,1461655148796,"Learn about the Force, Luke. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You must do what you feel is right, of course.

Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready. You'll have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba..."
718,1473354254961,"The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone. And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

Artoo? Artoo! Where are you?"

So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down? That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here.

You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.  I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.

Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! Oh, you did it!"

Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dack. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station Three-T-Eight. We have spotted Imperial walkers! Imperial walkers on the north ridge. Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.  All right, boys, keep tight now. Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now! All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armor's too strong for blasters."
723,1458535903748,"Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move.

What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? Hey, Luke...may the Force be with you! What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.

Where could they be? Close the blast doors! Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner, now I am the master. Only a master of evil, Darth. Your powers are weak, old man. You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. Easy...you call that easy? Their tracking us! Not this ship, sister. At least the information in Artoo is still intact. What's so important? What's he carrying? The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet! It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money! You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!"
724,1461645559285,"Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't... What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!

Rendezvous at mark six point one. This is Red Two. Flying toward you. Red Three, standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them off for a few seconds.

There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They're for sale if you want them. 

Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? Come on! "
725,1468307018656,"Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. Look, sir -- droids."
726,1456307173917,"We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures. Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead. The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally. Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough. I'm ready for anything. Come along, Artoo.

We don't serve their kind here! What? Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. I heartily agree with you sir. Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn't like you. I'm sorry. I don't like you either You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems. I'll be careful than. You'll be dead. This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something...

Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him?"
727,1472765957327,"Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by."
728,1460424592802,"Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.

Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been? Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me! Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life. I happen to like nice men. I'm a nice man. No, you're not. You're... Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

Artoo expresses his relief, also. How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark. Thanks to you. That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield. That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight."
729,1467758368543,"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.

Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. What's this? What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that? Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Who is she? She's beautiful. I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi... I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to... Is there more to this recording? Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master."
730,1484006106389,"The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone. And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. He will learn patience. Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father. Was I any different when you taught me? Hah. He is not ready. Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.

Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while."
731,1475087697634,"It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge."
732,1482131906695,"Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! Oh!! Luke! Luke! Grab him! What happened? I've got a very bad feeling about this. The walls are moving! Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something. Wait a minute! Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?

Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready. You'll have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now."
733,1456700772638,"Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back.

Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!

All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports. Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?  The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood? Right. Okay. Good luck. Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!

Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando. Lando system? Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him. Thanks.

Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while."
734,1458131992803,"Red Leader... This is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run. I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. Stay in attack formation! The exhaust post is... marked and locked in! Switch power to front deflector screens. How many guns do you think, Gold Five. I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers. Death Star will be in range in five minutes. Switching to targeting computer. Computer's locked. Getting a signal. The guns...they've stopped! Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.

And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!

735,1459468313693,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.

Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late!"
736,1470876758716,"Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you."
737,1476086470151,"Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do. No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend, hmm? I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master. Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda. You know him? Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come. Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.

No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!

What did you have in mind for your next move? Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas? No. Where are we? The Anoat system. Anoat system. There's not much there. No. 

What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!"
738,1476129938206,"You cannot hide forever, Luke. I will not fight you. Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...

Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi.

I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer."
739,1467984666249,"Luke, we're ready for takeoff. Good luck, Lando When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you. I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine. Princess, we'll find Han. I promise. Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal. Take care, you two. May the Force be with you. Ow!

Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!

No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian. Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain. You will not deviate from your present course. Rather touchy, aren't they? I thought you knew this person. Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that. Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven. Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me. Who's worried?

Oh! Nice to see a familiar face. E chu ta! ow rude! That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if... Hello? How interesting. Oh, my. Who are you? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!"
740,1476646337110,"Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point-blank range. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. She's gonna blow! I'm hit!

Cut it out! I'm not gonna hurt you. Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. All right. You want something to eat? That's right. Come on. Hmmm? Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? What is it? Freeze! Come on, get up! Go get your ride and take her back to base. Yes, sir. Come on, let's get outta here."
741,1465291407198,"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough... I feel terrible. Why are they doing this? They never even asked me any questions. Lando. Get out of here, Lando! Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. Over to you? They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. What about Han? Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.  Vader wants us all dead. He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.

You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up. Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right. Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo. Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope. Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed. Close the doors. Yes, sir.

Oh! Nice to see a familiar face. E chu ta! ow rude! That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if... Hello? How interesting. Oh, my. Who are you? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!

Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not.  don't want your help. I want my lamp back.

The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!

To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! Yes. We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.

Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. Easy...you call that easy? Their tracking us! Not this ship, sister. At least the information in Artoo is still intact. What's so important? What's he carrying? The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet! It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money! You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!"
744,1476471234140,"Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum. Those Rebels won't escape us. Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger. Right. ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations. As you wish. Lord Vader! My lord, we have them. 

There's something not right here. I feel cold, death. That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go. What's in there? Only what you take with you. our weapons...you will not need them.

Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.

Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.

The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend.

We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!"
746,1468054203330,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me.

Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. 

Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Luke! Where's Leia? What? She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!

Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.

This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this. Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me. Yes, my Lord. The Emperor has been expecting you. I know, father. So, you have accepted the truth. I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. That name no longer has any meaning for me."
747,1455894998754,"Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Yeah, sure. Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!! Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else. Hey! Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow. Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness! Do you understand anything they're saying? Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. What are you telling them? Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god."
748,1463703938636,"The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. That's impossible, even for a computer. It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters. Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!

Did you find any droids? No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked. Yes, sir. I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since... Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. 

Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now."
749,1463894439663,"So was I, if you'll remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. Will he finished what he begins? I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. Oh, you will be. You will be.

What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!

Artoo expresses his relief, also. How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark. Thanks to you. That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield. That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

You all right? Why are you still here? I heard the command center had been hit. You got your clearance to leave. Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope. Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters. Imperial troops have entered the base. Come on...that's it. Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports! K-one-zero...all troops disengage.  Oh! Wait for me! Begin retreat! Fall back!"
750,1486040535013,"Well, look at you, a general, huh? Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack. I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.

The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.

The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. "
751,1479061568807,"Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Proper?! It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.

Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above! Red Three, Red Two, pull in! Got it! Three of them coming in, twenty degrees! Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate. Pressure's steady. Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for. We're in attack position now, sir. Hold here. We're not going to attack? I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.

All wings report in. Red Leader standing by. Gray Leader standing by. Green Leader standing by. Lock S-foils in attack positions. May the Force be with us. We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no reading. Are you sure? Pull up! All craft pull up! Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47."
752,1473666247176,"Admiral. Yes, Captain I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had. We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads! The visuals indicate life readings. It could mean anything. If we followed every lead... But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms. You found something? Yes, my lord. That's it. The Rebels are there. My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be... hat is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men.

What is thy bidding, my master? There is a great disturbance in the Force. I have felt it. We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker. Yes, my master. He could destroy us. He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, my master.

Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.

Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know... Like we're being watched! Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here? I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm? Right. Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.  don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior. Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great."
753,1467576544978,"Luke? Luke? Luke? Have you seen Luke this morning? He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early. Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him? I think so. Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay! Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid...hit the accelerator.

Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.

Rendezvous at mark six point one. This is Red Two. Flying toward you. Red Three, standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them off for a few seconds.

Run, Luke! Run!"
754,1468763867178,"If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision. Father, please. Help me. Now, young Skywalker...you will die."
755,1458665067065,"Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports. Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another drill. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

How long before you can make the jump to light speed? It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer. Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining... Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? What's that flashing? We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.

Learn about the Force, Luke. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You must do what you feel is right, of course.

Did you find any droids? No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked. Yes, sir. I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since... Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.

I think so. Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay! Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid...hit the accelerator.

Chewie! Get behind me! Get behind me! Can't get out that way. Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. See-Threepio! See-Threepio! Yes sir?  We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that? I didn't copy! I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out, all other information on your level is restricted."
757,1476022166816,"What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?"
758,1468127111461,"If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie. We have you on our screen now. Please identify. Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield. Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. Transmission commencing. Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. It'll work. It'll work. Vader's on that ship. Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know. Fly casual. I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.

Where is that shuttle going? Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination? Parts and technical crew for the forest moon. Do they have a code clearance? It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. Shall I hold them? No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself. As you wish, my lord. Carry on. They're not goin' for it, Chewie. Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course. Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.

Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. 

We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this... I'm sure. Ugh! Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me."
759,1469516351191,"...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed. No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found. Lord Vader. Yes, Admiral, what is it? The Emperor commands you make contact with him. Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission. Yes, my lord.

Oh. No one to meet us. I don't like this. Well, what would you like? Well, they did let us land. Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me. See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay? Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled. How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! Inever thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?

Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners! I don't know how we're going to get out of this one. Oww! Chewie! That was no laser blast! Something hit us. Han, get up here! Come on, Chewie! Asteroids! Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one. What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field? They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they? You don't have to do this to impress me. Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one. Never tell me the odds!

General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.  A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you. Thank you, General.

Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack. Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary. ust hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable. Dack? Dack! Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing. Rouge Three. Copy, Rouge Leader Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass. oming around, Rouge Leader."
760,1467096415214,"I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.

It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny.

Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point-blank range. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. She's gonna blow! I'm hit!

Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late!

Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must."

Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. I want fifty thousand. No less. Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator. This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. Zeebuss. He agrees! Just relax for a moment.

Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo? Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. What is it? Some kind of local trouble? Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.

I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures. Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead. The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally. Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough. I'm ready for anything. Come along, Artoo.

Run, Luke! Run!

To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! Yes. We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned."

Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Yeah, sure. Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!! Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else. Hey! Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow. Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness! Do you understand anything they're saying? Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. What are you telling them? Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry. Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.

Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!

All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you?

Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me! Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no. 

It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny."
766,1455347401642,"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. Easy...you call that easy? Their tracking us! Not this ship, sister. At least the information in Artoo is still intact. What's so important? What's he carrying? The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet! It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money! You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!

Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? Come on! "
767,1459368227720,"Run, Luke! Run!"
768,1460504603708,"The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. Not for long...

Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!

You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.

Have you been in many battles? Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways. Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or... 

What are you doing hiding there? It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning, kept babbling on about his mission. Oh, no! That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir."
769,1455353700895,"The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.

770,1478362378294,"What's wrong? Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo? Okay, easy she goes! Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you.

Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year. You mean the next semester before harvest? Sure, there're more than enough droids. Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke. But it's a whole 'nother year. Look, it's only one more season. Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. Where are you going? It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids."
771,1455859282701,"Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi.

Da Eitha! Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota... Boscka! I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee. Oh, no! Chewbacca! At last we have the mighty Chewbacca. Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. I want fifty thousand. No less. Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator. This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. Zeebuss. He agrees! Just relax for a moment. 

No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me.

The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy. Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. What's he saying? He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.

Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Proper?! It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine."
772,1484379341214,"Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must.

Oh, I told you it was dangerous here. Shall we try and go around? It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us. Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here. Quietly, there might be more of them out there. Hey... it's me. Go for help! Go! Great. Come on. Over there! Two more of them! I see them. Wait, Leia! Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch! Hey, wait! Ahhh! Move closer! Get alongside that one! Get him! Keep on that one! I'll take these two!

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by.

The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. "
773,1482375478145,"Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic... Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan... You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her away!

Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!

Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. That's what I'm afraid of.

He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message. What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! Luke? Luke! Come to dinner! All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.

How long before you can make the jump to light speed? It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer. Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining... Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? What's that flashing? We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed."
774,1472332869461,"Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!

And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!

That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message. What message?

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone."
775,1485946678416,"What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always.

Chewie! Get behind me! Get behind me! Can't get out that way. Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. See-Threepio! See-Threepio! Yes sir?  We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that? I didn't copy! I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out, all other information on your level is restricted."
776,1465210492140,"Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dack. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station Three-T-Eight. We have spotted Imperial walkers! Imperial walkers on the north ridge. Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.  All right, boys, keep tight now. Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now! All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armor's too strong for blasters.

What is thy bidding, my master? There is a great disturbance in the Force. I have felt it. We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker. Yes, my master. He could destroy us. He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, my master.

Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it. Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.

Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. Stop that. Stop what? Stop that! My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of? Afraid? You're trembling. I'm not trembling.

Luke! You must complete the training. I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them. You must not go! But Han and Leia will die if I don't. You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate. But I can help them! I feel the Force! But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force. Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave! But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word. It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer. And that is why I have to go. Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader. You won't. Stopped they must be. On this depends. "
777,1484290339019,"It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins!"
778,1485497776611,"My scope's negative. I don't see anything. Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up. Biggs! You've picked one up...watch it! I can't see it! Where is he?! He's on me tight, I can't shake him...I can't shake him. Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in. Got him!

The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. Not for long...

What is it? I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keeps repeating, She's here. Well, who...who has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She's here? Princess? What's going on? Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something. What are you talking about? The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've got to help her. Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?

The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move."
779,1467473667603,"You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life. I happen to like nice men. I'm a nice man. No, you're not. You're... Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir."
780,1474798418208,"I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.

Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not? I am See-Threepio, human-cy... Yes or no will do. Oh. Well, yes. How many languages do you speak? I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him. Disintegrated? Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber. Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh! You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely. 

No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me.

We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this... I'm sure. Ugh! Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me."
781,1483926953945,"Learn about the Force, Luke. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You must do what you feel is right, of course.

This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs. I don't like the look of this. Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo? Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. What is it? Some kind of local trouble? Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.

What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.

Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him?"
782,1480697075601,"Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort... I find your lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this! Vader, release him! As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.

What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? Hey, Luke...may the Force be with you! What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.

You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! Oh!! Luke! Luke! Grab him! What happened? I've got a very bad feeling about this. The walls are moving! Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something. Wait a minute! Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?"
783,1482872878412,"What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!

Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord.

I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all. There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables. Mynocks? Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo! Wait a minute... All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!

What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is. Well, Calrissian, did he survive? Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation. He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker. Skywalker has just landed, my lord. Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship. You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision. I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further."
784,1467556447688,"Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!

I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.

The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by."
785,1462556528420,"Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here."
786,1458102173713,"Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports. Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another drill. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!

Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!

Run, Luke! Run!"
787,1457149083617,"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.

Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?"
788,1476933210624,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no."
789,1465715787013,"Did you find any droids? No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked. Yes, sir. I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since... Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. 

Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now."
790,1470013877302,"You cannot hide forever, Luke. I will not fight you. Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...

This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this. Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me. Yes, my Lord. The Emperor has been expecting you. I know, father. So, you have accepted the truth. I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. That name no longer has any meaning for me.

Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. "

All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. Charges! Come on, come on! Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. Freeze! You Rebel scum. 

Good luck. You're gonna need it. General Madine. We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator. Sounds dangerous. I wonder who they found to pull that off. General Solo, is your strike team assembled? Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Rawwwrr! Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one. Uh, General... count me in. I'm with you, too! What is it? Ask me again sometime. Luke. Hi, Han... Chewie. Exciting is hardly the word I would use.

Cut it out! I'm not gonna hurt you. Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. All right. You want something to eat? That's right. Come on. Hmmm? Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? What is it? Freeze! Come on, get up! Go get your ride and take her back to base. Yes, sir. Come on, let's get outta here.

792,1473581127013,"Have you been in many battles? Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways. Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or... 

Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! Sorry!"
793,1472959361094,"You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. That's your uncle talking. Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?"

See if they've been captured. Hurry! One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it! I'm trying! Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We've had some problems... Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great.

Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!

Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there... No! wait! Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed! Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed. Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst... It's worst. There's something alive in here! That's your imagination. Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? What? Help!

Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine."

Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me! Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no. 

Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead."
796,1461321034447,"Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me. My...! Why, you stuck up...half-witted...scruffy-looking...nerf-herder! Who's scruffy-looking? I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid? Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet? Headquarters personnel, report to command center. Take it easy. Excuse us, please.

What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!

Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you."
797,1475307715642,"Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. 

The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy. Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. What's he saying? He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge."
798,1461625919492,"You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. well, this could be it, sweetheart. I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm not going to argue with that. Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. Closer? Closer?! h, this is suicide! There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah. That'll do nicely. Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? I hope you know what you're doing. Yeah, me too.

You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life. I happen to like nice men. I'm a nice man. No, you're not. You're... Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!"
799,1465470494019,"But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not.  don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah! Oh, Artoo, let him have it. Mine! Mine! Artoo! Mine! Mine!

Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while."
800,1476434041536,"Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck. You, too.

Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?

801,1466909690421,"If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance. Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have. You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it... I have it ...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia. I know. Somehow...I've always known. Then you know why I have to face him.

Fighters coming in. There's too many of them! Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader.

All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. Charges! Come on, come on! Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. Freeze! You Rebel scum. "
802,1464237232840,"A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in range. That's no moon! It's a space station. It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about this. Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! But there's gotta be something you can do! There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight! You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.

Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move.

Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready. You'll have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!"
803,1459790812852,"You got her warmed? Yeah, she's comin' up. No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie. Hey, are you awake? Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again. Come on, General, let's move. Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody? All set. Here we go again. All right, hang on.

No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me.

This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message. There will be no bargain. We're doomed. I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is. Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite. What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh! "

The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you."
805,1476375017458,"What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser... He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord.

Luke! You must complete the training. I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them. You must not go! But Han and Leia will die if I don't. You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate. But I can help them! I feel the Force! But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force. Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave! But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word. It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer. And that is why I have to go. Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader. You won't. Stopped they must be. On this depends. 

I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

Artoo! You be more careful. Artoo - that way! Artoo! Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken? If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy."
806,1461059306197,"All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations. So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then? That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you. Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them."
807,1457147020734,"It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins!

Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification. These are not the droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your business. Move along. Move along. Move along.

What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? Hey, Luke...may the Force be with you! What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.

Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports. Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another drill. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!"
808,1465792158484,"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. Easy...you call that easy? Their tracking us! Not this ship, sister. At least the information in Artoo is still intact. What's so important? What's he carrying? The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet! It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money! You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!

Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there... No! wait! Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed! Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed. Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst... It's worst. There's something alive in here! That's your imagination. Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? What? Help!

General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.

Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!"
809,1464314951832,"Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready. You'll have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

Rendezvous at mark six point one. This is Red Two. Flying toward you. Red Three, standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them off for a few seconds.

Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports. Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another drill. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

I can't see a thing in this helmet. This is not going to work. Why didn't you say so before? I did say so before! Where are you taking this...thing? Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight. I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. Look out! We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal. What happened? Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? We're sending a squad up. Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous.  Who is this? What's your operating number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!"
810,1485638397603,"Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. It is pointless to resist, my son. Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.

Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late!

Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi.

Easy, Chewie. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! Hold it! Whoa! Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!"
811,1463700097725,"It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...I never heard of them hitting anything this big before. They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers. These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise. Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home! Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous. Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!

What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always."
812,1469775695502,"Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! Sorry!"
813,1472785765250,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-... Yes, sir? Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? Why not? Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.

Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader... No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on. You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!

I don't...I don't believe it. That is why you fail."
814,1472393091149,"Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!

Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.

And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.

Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! Get to the top! I can't Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. Hurry! One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it! I'm trying! Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We've had some problems... Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great.

Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. Okay, let's go. Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here! Is there anything I might do to help? Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on."
815,1455871289250,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. What's this? What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that? Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Who is she? She's beautiful. I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi... I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to... Is there more to this recording? Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.

That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir.

Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him?

Are they away? They have just made the jump into hyperspace. You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work."
816,1484731491567,"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. 

This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message. There will be no bargain. We're doomed. I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is. Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite. What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh! "
817,1481682311624,"Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don't know what you're talking about. You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know? 

What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is. Well, Calrissian, did he survive? Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation. He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker. Skywalker has just landed, my lord. Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship. You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision. I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.

Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando. Lando system? Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him. Thanks.

Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-... Yes, sir? Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? Why not? Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.

Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord."
818,1477663005404,"I told you to remain on the command ship. A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. Yes, I know. My son is with them. Are you sure? I have felt him, my Master. Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. They are clear, my Master. Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. He will come to me? I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you andthen you will bring him before me. As you wish.

Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead.

If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie. We have you on our screen now. Please identify. Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield. Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. Transmission commencing. Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. It'll work. It'll work. Vader's on that ship. Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know. Fly casual. I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.

Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right? Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die. Move him into position. Put him in."
819,1464707104283,"This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs. I don't like the look of this. Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo? Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. What is it? Some kind of local trouble? Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements."
820,1470490726974,"Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe?

Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready. You'll have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station! The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.... The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.

There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They're for sale if you want them. "
821,1481016385774,"Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don't know what you're talking about. You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know? 

Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back."
822,1478097717959,"Hey...hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? Three-two-six-eight-two-seven. If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here. Well, let's get moving! Where are you going? No, wait. They'll hear! Come here, you big coward! Chewie! Come here! Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay? Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me! It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this.

How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.

What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always."
823,1481736159820,"It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny.

Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!

If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision. Father, please. Help me. Now, young Skywalker...you will die.

Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message.

Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi."
824,1476621784760,"Rise, my friend. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. Yes, my Master. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. As you wish. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. 

Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. What's going on? I don't know. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. Thank you. Okay. He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day."
825,1483414673113,"Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate! Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. All right, I'll give it a try. No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try. I can't. It's too big. Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ..not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship! You want the impossible.

Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don't know what you're talking about. You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know? 

Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dack. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station Three-T-Eight. We have spotted Imperial walkers! Imperial walkers on the north ridge. Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.  All right, boys, keep tight now. Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now! All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armor's too strong for blasters.

What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?

Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!"
826,1455125326704,"Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. "
827,1477884397219,"All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!

What is thy bidding, my Master? Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. Yes, my Master."
828,1470114486870,"Fighters coming in. There's too many of them! Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader.

Easy, Chewie. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! Hold it! Whoa! Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!

It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge.

Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi.

Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point-blank range. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. She's gonna blow! I'm hit!"
829,1461351233925,"What is thy bidding, my Master? Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?

Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Luke! Where's Leia? What? She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!

Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message.

Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late!"
830,1478233590474,"I told you to remain on the command ship. A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. Yes, I know. My son is with them. Are you sure? I have felt him, my Master. Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. They are clear, my Master. Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. He will come to me? I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you andthen you will bring him before me. As you wish."
831,1468085359206,"Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.

Where is that shuttle going? Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination? Parts and technical crew for the forest moon. Do they have a code clearance? It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. Shall I hold them? No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself. As you wish, my lord. Carry on. They're not goin' for it, Chewie. Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course. Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.

Move! Move! The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it!

If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie. We have you on our screen now. Please identify. Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield. Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. Transmission commencing. Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. It'll work. It'll work. Vader's on that ship. Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know. Fly casual. I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here."
832,1479871772373,"Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.

Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back.

What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser... He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord.

Luke! You must complete the training. I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them. You must not go! But Han and Leia will die if I don't. You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate. But I can help them! I feel the Force! But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force. Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave! But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word. It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer. And that is why I have to go. Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader. You won't. Stopped they must be. On this depends. "
833,1475360674449,"Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports. Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another drill. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always.

A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in range. That's no moon! It's a space station. It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about this. Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! But there's gotta be something you can do! There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight! You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.

Lock the door, Artoo. All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next door. I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. You watch your language!

You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. That's your uncle talking. Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?"
834,1455223249590,"You got her warmed? Yeah, she's comin' up. No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie. Hey, are you awake? Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again. Come on, General, let's move. Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody? All set. Here we go again. All right, hang on.

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by.

Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here.

That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time."
835,1456793518802,"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough... I feel terrible. Why are they doing this? They never even asked me any questions. Lando. Get out of here, Lando! Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. Over to you? They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. What about Han? Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.  Vader wants us all dead. He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.

Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando. Lando system? Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him. Thanks.

Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord."
836,1470615939844,"Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. 

I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say? I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. Leia! Oh! Your Royal Highness. But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free. Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly -- Just tell them. You see, Master Luke they didn't believe me. Just as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. Thanks, Threepio. I...I never knew I had it in me.

It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny.

837,1475697755120,"Good luck. You're gonna need it. General Madine. We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator. Sounds dangerous. I wonder who they found to pull that off. General Solo, is your strike team assembled? Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Rawwwrr! Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one. Uh, General... count me in. I'm with you, too! What is it? Ask me again sometime. Luke. Hi, Han... Chewie. Exciting is hardly the word I would use.

Well, look at you, a general, huh? Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack. I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.

It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me.

If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance. Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have. You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it... I have it ...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia. I know. Somehow...I've always known. Then you know why I have to face him."

Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message.

You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack"
839,1467844701318,"Luke? Luke? Luke? Have you seen Luke this morning? He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early. Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him? I think so. Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay! Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid...hit the accelerator."
840,1466522396554,"How long before you can make the jump to light speed? It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer. Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining... Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? What's that flashing? We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.

All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this. All right. What's your plan? Uh...Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you. Okay. Han, you put these on. Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind. Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking...but, ah...what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here? Lock the door! And hope they don't have blasters. That isn't very reassuring.

He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand. It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.

Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification. These are not the droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your business. Move along. Move along. Move along.

Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. Look, sir -- droids."

It looks like our droid...hit the accelerator.

The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. Not for long...

Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion."
842,1461067872956,"We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.

General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope."
843,1475087328897,"All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this. All right. What's your plan? Uh...Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you. Okay. Han, you put these on. Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind. Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking...but, ah...what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here? Lock the door! And hope they don't have blasters. That isn't very reassuring.

You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. That's your uncle talking. Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?

All wings report in. Red Ten standing by. Red Seven standing by. Red Three standing by. Red Six standing by. Red Nine standing by. Red Two standing by. Red Eleven standing by. Red Five standing by. Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through their magnetic field. Hold tight! Switch your deflectors on. Double front!"
844,1455423102255,"You all right? Why are you still here? I heard the command center had been hit. You got your clearance to leave. Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope. Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters. Imperial troops have entered the base. Come on...that's it. Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports! K-one-zero...all troops disengage.  Oh! Wait for me! Begin retreat! Fall back!

Distance to power generators? One-seven, decimal two-eight. Target. Maximum fire power. Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon. But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!! Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical. Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident! Wait! Wait!

...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed. No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found. Lord Vader. Yes, Admiral, what is it? The Emperor commands you make contact with him. Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission. Yes, my lord."
845,1483104860343,"Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil. Patience. And sacrifice Han and Leia? If you honor what they fight for...yes! If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters. Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side. Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse. That boy is our last hope. No. There is another.

Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield. Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector. Good. Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control....Fire! The first transport is away.

If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish. What's going on...buddy? You're being put into carbon freeze. What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me. The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in! Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...! Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop! Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die. Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me? I love you! I know.

Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh! You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett. Yes, my lord. Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader.

You have learned much, young one. You'll find I'm full of surprises. Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true. No! All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. Impressive...most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me."
846,1474356048168,"Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.

Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie.

You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.  I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way."
847,1481155446376,"It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge.

Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message.

Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete."
848,1483209064290,"Learn about the Force, Luke. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You must do what you feel is right, of course.

Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. Easy...you call that easy? Their tracking us! Not this ship, sister. At least the information in Artoo is still intact. What's so important? What's he carrying? The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet! It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money! You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!

Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts. What's going on? Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan! What do you mean? Where is it? Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed...by the Empire!

Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine."
849,1469860640987,"That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!"
850,1475172729099,"Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above! Red Three, Red Two, pull in! Got it! Three of them coming in, twenty degrees! Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate. Pressure's steady. Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for. We're in attack position now, sir. Hold here. We're not going to attack? I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.

Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry. Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. 

Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late!

We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you."
851,1478547839549,"You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. That's your uncle talking. Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?

Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through their magnetic field. Hold tight! Switch your deflectors on. Double front!

Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir.

You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers."
852,1474131738535,"Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must.

Where is that shuttle going? Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination? Parts and technical crew for the forest moon. Do they have a code clearance? It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. Shall I hold them? No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself. As you wish, my lord. Carry on. They're not goin' for it, Chewie. Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course. Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.

I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. Yoda will always be with you. Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view! Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. 

It's a trap!

Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not? I am See-Threepio, human-cy... Yes or no will do. Oh. Well, yes. How many languages do you speak? I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him. Disintegrated? Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber. Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh! You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely. "
853,1481053553646,"Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Yeah, sure. Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!! Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else. Hey! Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow. Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness! Do you understand anything they're saying? Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. What are you telling them? Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

Cut it out! I'm not gonna hurt you. Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. All right. You want something to eat? That's right. Come on. Hmmm? Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? What is it? Freeze! Come on, get up! Go get your ride and take her back to base. Yes, sir. Come on, let's get outta here."
854,1459620296938,"Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi.

Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not? I am See-Threepio, human-cy... Yes or no will do. Oh. Well, yes. How many languages do you speak?

You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely. 

What is thy bidding, my Master? Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. Yes, my Master."
855,1479587816097,"We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you.

Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny.

All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. Charges! Come on, come on! Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. Freeze! You Rebel scum. "
856,1464353267223,"Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. 

Luke! Luke! Oh, Master Luke. I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia. I hope she's alright. What, Chewie? What? Chewie! Hey, I don't get it. Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie. Chewie, wa-wait! Don't! 

Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage. Han! Luke! Are you all right? Fine. Together again, huh? Wouldn't miss it. How are we doing? The same as always. That bad, huh? Where's Leia? I'm here. Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. Good, I hate long waits. You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. Doesn't sound so bad. In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years. On second thought, let's pass on that, huh? You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make. 

Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. What's going on? I don't know. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. Thank you. Okay. He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.

Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. Artoo whistles timidly. Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit. Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose. There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke. "
857,1457690201756,"Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!

Stretch out with your feelings. You see, you can do it. I call it luck. In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else. Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan. You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.

There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They're for sale if you want them. 

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You mean it controls your actions? Partially. But it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me! Pull in! Luke...pull in! Watch your back, Luke! Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in! I'm hit, but not bad. Artoo, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there. Red Six... Can you see Red Five? There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you? I can't shake him! I'm on him, Luke! Hold on! Blast it! Wedge where are you? Thanks, Wedge. Good shooting, Wedge!"
858,1456821739060,"Oh! Nice to see a familiar face. E chu ta! ow rude! That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if... Hello? How interesting. Oh, my. Who are you? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!

Artoo? Artoo! Where are you?"
859,1461832768880,"Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here.

Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi."
860,1484150582654,"It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny.

Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!

Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must.

Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry. Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. "
861,1469769067258,"Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. 

Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield. The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed. We're starting our approach. Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived. Yes, sir."
862,1466049830839,"Rise, my friend. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. Yes, my Master. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. As you wish. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. Yoda will always be with you. Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view! Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. 

The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. "
863,1486563486328,"It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge.

All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. Charges! Come on, come on! Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. Freeze! You Rebel scum. 

As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire!

Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master. You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father. Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. His lightsaber. Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.

Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not? I am See-Threepio, human-cy... Yes or no will do. Oh. Well, yes. How many languages do you speak? I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him. Disintegrated? Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber. Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh! You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely. "
864,1483021755965,"A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in range. That's no moon! It's a space station. It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about this. Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! But there's gotta be something you can do! There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight! You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting."
865,1472785108289,"What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!

Luke. Father. Son, come with me. Ben, why didn't you tell me? Chewie! It's Vader. Luke...it is your destiny. Ben, why didn't you tell me?

Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield. Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector. Good. Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control....Fire! The first transport is away."
866,1457716824407,"Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!"
867,1476036179242,"Wake up! Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. I have no need for a protocol droid. Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators. You could say... Do you speak Bocce? Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me...I'm as fluent in... All right shut up! I'll take this one.

Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him?

Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?

All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations. So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then? That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you. Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.

And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!"
